As we observe the continuous evolution of technology, it has created new  business prospects for companies to harness the power of the internet in providing online shopping  services that connect consumers, service providers, and intermediary traders. E-commerce has  emerged as a vital platform supporting commercial transactions via the internet. Prior to making  a purchase, consumers frequently turn to social media for product reviews, where electronic word  of mouth enables users to share their product-buying experiences. This study seeks to investigate  the impact of user-generated information through electronic word of mouth on purchase intentions  within the e-commerce landscape of Indonesia, utilizing the Information Acceptance Model  (IACM). Employing a causal descriptive research approach, this study targeted e-commerce users  in Indonesia, with 155 respondents participating. Data collection was carried out through Google  Forms, and the collected data was analyzed using SmartPLS 3. Hypothetical testing included t- tests, p-tests, and path coefficient assessments. The study's findings revealed that variables such  as information quantity, information needs, attitudes toward information, information usability,  and information adoption all play a significant role in influencing purchase intentions, while in- formation quality and information credibility had no discernible impact on purchase intentions.",2024,"Adhi Prasetio, Nadiya Aulia Witarsyah, Indrawati"

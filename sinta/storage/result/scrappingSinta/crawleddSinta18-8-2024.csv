This is why regular screenings or health checks are necessary to detect cancer lesions early. Since bone scan images have become the primary means of detecting the emergence of cancer lesions on bone, high segmentation accuracy is essential for establishing the model of some predefined regions in bone scan images where cancer metastasis was predicted to appear. Consequently, robust localization and identification of the specific region in bone scan images are required for automated metastasis detection. To this end, we propose Efficient-BtrflyNet, a new deep learning-based architecture for skeleton segmentation of whole-body bone scan images. The proposed architecture exploits the benefits of EfficientNet’s model scaling and the encoder–decoder design of butterfly-type networks. We added EfficientNetB7 to the encoder section to obtain more specific features. The proposed architecture simultaneously processes anterior and posterior whole-body bone scan images. Using 37 bone scan images, we evaluated the performance of our proposed skeleton segmentation system using the Dice score. Efficient-BtrflyNet achieves superior segmentation performance compared to the existing representative method. © The Author(s) 2024."

This study provides insight into the temporal and spatial variability of bow echo distribution and presents the atmospheric condition associated with the bow echo events. Temporal analysis is categorical into monthly, seasonally, and diurnal. The analysis was performed using X-band radar network and reanalysis data (ERA5). Result: At least 26 bow echoes were identified across the Bandung basin from X-band radar network during the study period. From this total number of bow echoes, the observation of initiation modes is primarily generated from a weakly organized cell, with few coming from the squall line. The bow echo mostly evolved from noon until afternoon. The rainy season (December–January–February) and transition season (March–April–May) is the most frequent period of bow echo occurrence, with March being the most active month. Nevertheless, this study also found bow echo occurrence in the dry season (June–July–August). For the spatial analysis, the studied area is divided into two regions representing the eastern and western part of Bandung basin. The eastern region recorded the most intense occurrences with 14 events. The movement of bow echo in this region covered a shorter distance (average distance only 4.56 km), with all initiation modes occurring inside the region. The atmospheric condition within this region has less moisture flux, with higher CAPE and slightly higher surface temperature. Meanwhile, in the western region have different characteristics with higher moisture flux, a slight effect of CAPE and CINH, with longer distance and zonal movement direction of bow echo displacement. Conclusion: These conditions indicate that local convection is the dominant mode of bow echo initiation mode in the eastern region of Bandung basin. Meanwhile, the monsoon effect influences the bow echo initiation mode in the western region. Given that the observed 4-year bow echo has different characteristics from previous studies of bow echo in mid latitudes, developing different criteria for bow echo detection in the tropics is crucial. © The Author(s) 2024."

However, existing devices often require expert handling, highlighting the need for alternative methods to simplify the process. Researchers have developed various methods using physiological signals to address this issue. Yet, many of these methods either fall short in accuracy according to the BHS, AAMI, and IEEE standards for BP measurement devices or suffer from low computational efficiency due to the complexity of their models. To solve this problem, we developed a BP prediction system that merges extracted features of PPG and ECG from two pulses of both signals using convolutional and LSTM layers, followed by incorporating the R-to-R interval durations as additional features for predicting systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure. Our findings indicate that the prediction accuracies for SBP and DBP were 5.306 ± 7.248 mmHg with a 0.877 correlation coefficient and 3.296 ± 4.764 mmHg with a 0.918 correlation coefficient, respectively. We found that our proposed model achieved a robust performance on the MIMIC III dataset with a minimum architectural design and high-level accuracy compared to existing methods. Thus, our method not only meets the passing category for BHS, AAMI, and IEEE guidelines but also stands out as the most rapidly accurate deep-learning-based BP measurement device currently available. © The Author(s) 2024."

Various new businesses have surfaced with the rise of online marketing (E-Commerce) in response to Covid-19 pandemic. This phenomenon allows recommendation items through a system called Collaborative Filtering (CF), aiming to improve shopping experience of users. Typically, the effectiveness of CF relies on the precise identification of similar profile users by similarity algorithms. Traditional similarity measures are based on the user-item rating matrix. Approximately, four custom ratings (CR) were used along with a new rating formula, termed New Custom Rating (NCR), derived from the popularity of users and items in addition to the original rating. Specifically, NCR optimized recommendation system performance by using the popularity of users and items to determine new ratings value, rather than solely relying on the original rating. Additionally, the formulas improved the representativeness of the new rating values and the accuracy of similarity algorithm calculations. Consequently, the increased accuracy of recommendation system was achieved. The implementation of NCR across four CR algorithms and recommendation system using five public datasets was examined. Consequently, the experimental results showed that NCR significantly increased recommendation system accuracy, as evidenced by reductions in RMSE, MSE, and MAE as well as increasing FCP and Hit Rate. Moreover, by combining the popularity of users and items into rating calculations, NCR improved the accuracy of various recommendation system algorithms reducing RMSE, MSE, and MAE up to 62.10%, 53.62%, 65.97%, respectively, while also increasing FCP and Hit Rate up to 11.89% and 31.42%, respectively. © The Author(s) 2024."

The focus is to examine the topic of halal food product purchase intention. Here, we focus specifically on Muslim teenagers in Indonesia to explore whether they still hold on to the halal principle that most Muslims adhere to when consuming food. This research examine their halal awareness based on theory of planned behavior (TPB) theory and compare it to the previous publications so far. To reach this objective, we used quantitative methodology. Our data was acquired from 161 Indonesian young Muslim consumers. Furthermore, the variance-based structural equation modeling and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) research model were utilized. Our findings demonstrate that subjective norm and attitude are significant determinants of halal food buying intent. However, perceived behavioral control has not been established as a purchase intention component.

The common methods used to obtain poverty information are surveys and censuses. However, this process takes a long time and uses a lot of human resources. On the other hand, governments and policymakers need a faster approach to know social-economic conditions for area development plans. Hence, in this paper, we develop e-commerce data and machine learning algorithms as a proxy for poverty levels that can provide faster information than surveys or censuses. The e-commerce dataset is used and this high-dimensional data becomes a challenge. Hence, feature selection algorithms are employed to determine the best features before building a machine learning model. Furthermore, three machine learning algorithms such as support vector regression, linear regression, and k-nearest neighbor are compared to predict the poverty rate. Hence, the contribution of this paper is to propose the combination of statistical-based feature selection and machine learning algorithms to predict the poverty rate based on e-commerce data. According to the experimental results, the combination of f-score feature selection and support vector regression surpasses other methods. It shows that e-commerce data and machine learning algorithms can be potentially used as a proxy for predicting poverty. © The Author(s) 2024."

The dataset for the DNN model is obtained by simulating tsunami wave attenuation using the Boussinesq model with a staggered grid approximation. The Boussinesq model for wave attenuation is validated using laboratory experiments exhibiting a mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 0.003 to 0.01. We employ over 40,000 data points generated from the Boussinesq numerical simulations to train the DNN. Efforts are made to optimize hyperparameters and determine the neural network architecture to attain optimal performance during the training process. The prediction results of the DNN model exhibit a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.99560, an MAE of 0.00118, a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.00151, and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3 %. When comparing the DNN model with three alternative machine learning models— support vector regression (SVR), multiple linear regression (MLR), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)— the performance of DNN is superior to that of SVR and MLR, but it is similar to XGBoost. • High-accuracy DNN models require hyperparameter optimization and neural network architecture selection. • The error of DNN models in predicting the attenuation of tsunami waves by mangrove forests is less than 3 %. • DNN can serve as an alternate predictive model to empirical formulas or classical numerical models. © 2024"

Understanding and forecasting the distribution patterns of disease cases and climate change phenomena has become a focal point of researchers around the world. Machine learning models for prediction can generally be classified into 2: based on previous patterns such as LSTM and based on causal factors such as Naive Bayes and other classifiers. The main drawback of models such as Naive Bayes is that it does not have the ability to predict future trends because it only make predictionsin the present time. In this study, we propose a novel approach that makes the Naive Bayes classifier capable of predicting future classification. The process of expanding the dimension of the feature matrix based on historical data from several previous time periods is performed to obtain a long-term classification prediction model using Naive Bayes. The case studies used are the prediction of the distribution of the annual number of dengue fever cases in Bandung City and the distribution of monthly rainfall in Java Island, Indonesia.

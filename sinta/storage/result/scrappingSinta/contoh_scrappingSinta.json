One of the solutions is to create reliable infrastructure that can support application performance. Kubernetes is a platform which offers one of the solutions by providing container application orchestration and enabling high availability and scalability through various automatic scaling mechanisms such as Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), which dynamically scales the number of pod resources without restarting the entire system. By default, Kubernetes only monitors built-in resource metrics such as CPU and memory usage for each host machine and pod. To use Custom Metrics, external software such as Prometheus can be employed to monitor metrics as needed. On the other hand, Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) software offers a solution to simplify and facilitate autoscaling by efficiently implementing event-based automatic scaling and achieving the scale-to-zero capability.

Kubernetes is a platform which offers one of the solutions by providing container application orchestration and enabling high availability and scalability through various automatic scaling mechanisms such as Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), which dynamically scales the number of pod resources without restarting the entire system. By default, Kubernetes only monitors built-in resource metrics such as CPU and memory usage for each host machine and pod.

The objective is to find a maximum impact which can activate users in spreading advertisement marketing campaign through social network. This paper contributes an influence analysis on Instagram and reproduces it into a hashtag network by transforming postings with hashtag interdependence. In finding optimal paths such network structure with influence probabilities, we employ Floyd-Warshall algorithm under uncertainty.

Even though it has the charm of beaches, natural tourist destinations are still the primary choice compared to cultural and artificial sites. However, limited studies exist regarding standard indicators for assessing natural tourism potential in Rembang Regency, which is essential for identifying potential tourist locations. This research focuses on grouping indicators of natural tourism potential based on six main aspects: attractions, amenities, accommodation, activity, accessibility, and ancillary services, environment in tourist areas, and human resources considerations. A taxonomic model will be utilized to develop a procedure for determining natural tourism potential, including indicator weighing via a hierarchical analysis. The findings will yield a taxonomy model aiding information and knowledge management, fostering information sharing and utilization. Moreover, the established procedures will facilitate an accurate and efficient determination of natural tourism potential. This research aims to contribute to sustainable natural tourism management in Rembang Regency, preserving nature while enhancing the tourist experience. \u00a9 2024 by the authors.Author keywordshierarchical analysis;indicator grouping;procedure;taxonomic model;tourism potential assessmentIndexed keywordsRegional IndexCentral Java;IndonesiaGEOBASE Subject Indexassessment method;ecotourism;knowledge;spatiotemporal analysis;tourism management;tourist destinationSustainable Development GoalsLearn more Sustainable Development GoalsSustainable Development Goals mapped to this documentDecent work and economic growthGoal 8Responsible consumption and productionGoal 12Partnership for the goalsGoal 17SciVal TopicsLearn about these TopicsTopic nameEmotions; Heritage Tourism; Tourist ExperienceProminence percentile97.851Prominence is an indicator that show the current momentum of a Topic.

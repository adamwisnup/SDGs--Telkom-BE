This is why regular screenings or health checks are necessary to detect cancer lesions early. Since bone scan images have become the primary means of detecting the emergence of cancer lesions on bone, high segmentation accuracy is essential for establishing the model of some predefined regions in bone scan images where cancer metastasis was predicted to appear. Consequently, robust localization and identification of the specific region in bone scan images are required for automated metastasis detection. To this end, we propose Efficient-BtrflyNet, a new deep learning-based architecture for skeleton segmentation of whole-body bone scan images. The proposed architecture exploits the benefits of EfficientNet’s model scaling and the encoder–decoder design of butterfly-type networks. We added EfficientNetB7 to the encoder section to obtain more specific features. The proposed architecture simultaneously processes anterior and posterior whole-body bone scan images. Using 37 bone scan images, we evaluated the performance of our proposed skeleton segmentation system using the Dice score. Efficient-BtrflyNet achieves superior segmentation performance compared to the existing representative method. © The Author(s) 2024."

This study provides insight into the temporal and spatial variability of bow echo distribution and presents the atmospheric condition associated with the bow echo events. Temporal analysis is categorical into monthly, seasonally, and diurnal. The analysis was performed using X-band radar network and reanalysis data (ERA5). Result: At least 26 bow echoes were identified across the Bandung basin from X-band radar network during the study period. From this total number of bow echoes, the observation of initiation modes is primarily generated from a weakly organized cell, with few coming from the squall line. The bow echo mostly evolved from noon until afternoon. The rainy season (December–January–February) and transition season (March–April–May) is the most frequent period of bow echo occurrence, with March being the most active month. Nevertheless, this study also found bow echo occurrence in the dry season (June–July–August). For the spatial analysis, the studied area is divided into two regions representing the eastern and western part of Bandung basin. The eastern region recorded the most intense occurrences with 14 events. The movement of bow echo in this region covered a shorter distance (average distance only 4.56 km), with all initiation modes occurring inside the region. The atmospheric condition within this region has less moisture flux, with higher CAPE and slightly higher surface temperature. Meanwhile, in the western region have different characteristics with higher moisture flux, a slight effect of CAPE and CINH, with longer distance and zonal movement direction of bow echo displacement. Conclusion: These conditions indicate that local convection is the dominant mode of bow echo initiation mode in the eastern region of Bandung basin. Meanwhile, the monsoon effect influences the bow echo initiation mode in the western region. Given that the observed 4-year bow echo has different characteristics from previous studies of bow echo in mid latitudes, developing different criteria for bow echo detection in the tropics is crucial. © The Author(s) 2024."

However, existing devices often require expert handling, highlighting the need for alternative methods to simplify the process. Researchers have developed various methods using physiological signals to address this issue. Yet, many of these methods either fall short in accuracy according to the BHS, AAMI, and IEEE standards for BP measurement devices or suffer from low computational efficiency due to the complexity of their models. To solve this problem, we developed a BP prediction system that merges extracted features of PPG and ECG from two pulses of both signals using convolutional and LSTM layers, followed by incorporating the R-to-R interval durations as additional features for predicting systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure. Our findings indicate that the prediction accuracies for SBP and DBP were 5.306 ± 7.248 mmHg with a 0.877 correlation coefficient and 3.296 ± 4.764 mmHg with a 0.918 correlation coefficient, respectively. We found that our proposed model achieved a robust performance on the MIMIC III dataset with a minimum architectural design and high-level accuracy compared to existing methods. Thus, our method not only meets the passing category for BHS, AAMI, and IEEE guidelines but also stands out as the most rapidly accurate deep-learning-based BP measurement device currently available. © The Author(s) 2024."

Various new businesses have surfaced with the rise of online marketing (E-Commerce) in response to Covid-19 pandemic. This phenomenon allows recommendation items through a system called Collaborative Filtering (CF), aiming to improve shopping experience of users. Typically, the effectiveness of CF relies on the precise identification of similar profile users by similarity algorithms. Traditional similarity measures are based on the user-item rating matrix. Approximately, four custom ratings (CR) were used along with a new rating formula, termed New Custom Rating (NCR), derived from the popularity of users and items in addition to the original rating. Specifically, NCR optimized recommendation system performance by using the popularity of users and items to determine new ratings value, rather than solely relying on the original rating. Additionally, the formulas improved the representativeness of the new rating values and the accuracy of similarity algorithm calculations. Consequently, the increased accuracy of recommendation system was achieved. The implementation of NCR across four CR algorithms and recommendation system using five public datasets was examined. Consequently, the experimental results showed that NCR significantly increased recommendation system accuracy, as evidenced by reductions in RMSE, MSE, and MAE as well as increasing FCP and Hit Rate. Moreover, by combining the popularity of users and items into rating calculations, NCR improved the accuracy of various recommendation system algorithms reducing RMSE, MSE, and MAE up to 62.10%, 53.62%, 65.97%, respectively, while also increasing FCP and Hit Rate up to 11.89% and 31.42%, respectively. © The Author(s) 2024."

The dataset for the DNN model is obtained by simulating tsunami wave attenuation using the Boussinesq model with a staggered grid approximation. The Boussinesq model for wave attenuation is validated using laboratory experiments exhibiting a mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 0.003 to 0.01. We employ over 40,000 data points generated from the Boussinesq numerical simulations to train the DNN. Efforts are made to optimize hyperparameters and determine the neural network architecture to attain optimal performance during the training process. The prediction results of the DNN model exhibit a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.99560, an MAE of 0.00118, a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.00151, and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3 %. When comparing the DNN model with three alternative machine learning models— support vector regression (SVR), multiple linear regression (MLR), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)— the performance of DNN is superior to that of SVR and MLR, but it is similar to XGBoost. • High-accuracy DNN models require hyperparameter optimization and neural network architecture selection. • The error of DNN models in predicting the attenuation of tsunami waves by mangrove forests is less than 3 %. • DNN can serve as an alternate predictive model to empirical formulas or classical numerical models. © 2024"

In certain cases, these metamodels need to be extended to incorporate other business models for the business–IT alignment used in enterprises.

There are two main approaches employed in this study, namely examining process: 1) developing a software artefact as evidence as well as comparative features analysis of authoring tools; and examining the end product 2) selecting relevant heuristics and getting experts to evaluate. A selected cohort of students were trained to use Wick Editor. At the end of the training, they were required to develop educational games. In the process, Wick Editor was assessed in terms of functionalities. A heuristics protocol engaging 18 educators was used to assess the educational games developed by students.

Recently, there has been interest in ransomware classification using DNN and Bi-LSTM. DNN, a subset of machine learning techniques, has been found to improve ransomware detection and classification precision and efficacy. Ransomware has been affecting commercial, public, and governmental organizations' networks and computer systems for more than a decade, enabling new dynamic detection techniques to help DNNs detect ransomware. However, deep neural network-based architectures and DL classifiers (such as DNN, and Bi-LSTM classifiers) will be employed to detect ransomware. These networks may learn to correctly identify and categorize new ransomware incidents by integrating various datasets, including known and unknown ransomware samples. The classification of ransomware detection has been thoroughly investigated, and a model incorporating classic DL techniques with DNN and Bi-LSTM-based architecture will be proposed. A model execution experiment will be carried out to facilitate comparative testing of various approaches. This study focuses on the detection and classification of ransomware using DNN and Bi-LSTM. This study provides the groundwork for future investigations into the issues with ransomware detection.

Understanding and forecasting the distribution patterns of disease cases and climate change phenomena has become a focal point of researchers around the world. Machine learning models for prediction can generally be classified into 2: based on previous patterns such as LSTM and based on causal factors such as Naive Bayes and other classifiers. The main drawback of models such as Naive Bayes is that it does not have the ability to predict future trends because it only make predictionsin the present time. In this study, we propose a novel approach that makes the Naive Bayes classifier capable of predicting future classification. The process of expanding the dimension of the feature matrix based on historical data from several previous time periods is performed to obtain a long-term classification prediction model using Naive Bayes.

Initially hindered by a lack of a sophisticated monitoring and control system, the existing production relied heavily on manual time calculations, leading to high risk of inaccuracies and errors. To address this, the study proposes a novel redesign of the control system for the hammer mill machine, particularly in the panel section, using the waterfall design methodology. This strategic redesign has led to the implementation of an advanced automation system, which significantly streamlines the process by automatically displaying time and power consumption data on the HMI display. This enhancement not only simplifies monitoring and control, but also substantially boosts efficiency. The results show a reduction in the hammer mill machine's operating time by 13 seconds, an increase in productivity by 48%, and reveal power consumption details for the motor and conveyor bucket.

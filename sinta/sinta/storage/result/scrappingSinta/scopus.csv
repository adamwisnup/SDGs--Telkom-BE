However, the issue is whether all students are prepared for the changes in the learning method. This paper presents a study on students’ motivation in an online learning environment of the Introduction to Engineering Design course. The first objective is to identify the differences in students’ motivations between the early and end of the semester. The is adapted from Pintrich’s Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). The questionnaire consists of six constructs: intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, task values, control of learning, self-efficacy, and self-regulation. The data collected are analyzed using Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test. The results show no significant difference in the overall students’ motivation between the beginning and the end of the semester (p=0.856). However, based on the six constructs, intrinsic motivation (p=0.034) and self-regulation (p=0.005) are identified to be significantly different. The second objective is to investigate the factors affecting students' online learning motivation. Responses on four items are tested using Multiple Linear Regression. The findings indicate that the lecturer’s contribution and guidance are the most significant factor influencing students’ motivation. Results from this study suggest that in conjunction with the online challenges, students establish their expectations at the beginning of the semester, and towards the end, they can adapt and act appropriately to suit the circumstances. Secondly, the lecturers' contribution and guidance are significant predictors of students’ motivation in online learning. © 2024, Semarak Ilmu Publishing. All rights reserved."

Allium ampeloprasum var. porrum water extracts have gotten a lot of attention because of their bioactive components, such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and alkaloids, which have a variety of pharmacological activities, including antiproliferative actions. This study aimed to evaluate the histological and molecular effects of Allium ampeloprasum (leek) water extract on the proliferation of the murine gingival cancer cell line. Histological evaluation was conducted to examine morphological changes induced by extract treatment. Molecular mechanisms underlying the observed histological changes were investigated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Expression levels of key genes associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed. Histological findings revealed a dose-dependent decrease (100, 50, 25, 12.5, and 6.25 µg/ml) in cell density and altered cell shape in the treated cell line. Also, the percentage of inhibition for the oral mucosa cell line was high, with a significant P of 0.006, in the treated group compared to the control group. Additionally, water extract has an IC50 value of 61 g/ml. The P53 fold increment of gene expression is 0.6, which means the expression level in the experimental condition is 60% higher than the control. This study provides evidence for the potential antiproliferative activity of Allium ampeloprasum water extract on the oral mucosa cell line. The observed histological changes, coupled with the modulation of key genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis, suggest that leek water extract may have therapeutic implications in managing oral cancer. © 2024, Bogor Agricultural University.

The present numerical algorithm, which extends the previous one-dimensional reduced two-layer non-hydrostatic scheme (NH-2LR), solves 3D incompressible Euler equations with hydrodynamic pressure distribution parameterization. This approach allows us to reduce the computational cost of the NH-2LR model, being relatively comparable to that of a one-layer model, while maintaining the accuracy of the full two-layer model. Comparison with analytical solutions demonstrates that the NH-2LR model can simulate landslide-generated waves up to a dispersion level of μ=0.4, indicating its validity in shallow to intermediate water depth areas. Validation of the NH-2LR model with experimental data provides numerical results with an error of less than 10.29%. The final simulation employs the actual topography of Palu Bay. To mimic the 2018 Palu tsunami, we apply landslide scenarios as proposed in the literature. The NH-2LR model simulates landslide-generated tsunamis in Palu Bay, and the computed wave signals at the Pantoloan tide gauge station yield an error below 20.19% compared to available field data. All assessments showed the merits of our NH-2LR model in simulating tsunami waves generated by submarine landslides. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The study utilized two control variables, vaccination, and therapy, to construct a control function that relied on the quadratic Lyapunov function. The control objective was to lower the number of COVID-19 infections while maintaining system stability. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used as a novel method to estimate controller parameter value to replace the previously used parameter tuning procedure. Then, a numerical simulation was carried out implementing three control scenarios, namely vaccination control only, treatment control only, and vaccination and treatment control simultaneously.

Meanwhile, the no-free-lunch (NFL) theory becomes the major consideration in the massive development of metaheuristic as there is not any ideal metaheuristic can solve all problems superiorly. Based on this problem, this work is aimed at introducing a novel metaphor-free swarm-based metaheuristic called iteration-controlled mixture optimizer (ICMO). ICMO contains three directed searches where the reference in each search is constructed by two entities. The first reference is the mixture between the finest entity and the mean of the finer entities. The second reference is the mixture between the finest entity and a randomly chosen entity. The third reference is the mixture between the finest entity and any generated entity within space. The portion between the first and second entities in each reference is controlled by the iteration. Then, ICMO is compared with five new swarm-based metaheuristics: attack leave optimization (ALO), total interaction algorithm (TIA), fully informed search algorithm (FISA), walrus optimization algorithm (WaOA), and ono-to-one based optimization (OOBO). The assessment result shows that ICMO is better than ALO, TIA, FISA, WaOA, and OOBO in 15, 13, 20, 12, and 20 functions out of 23 functions respectively. Then, ICMO is also challenged to solve the economic load dispatch (ELD) problem in the Java-Bali electricity system in Indonesia. The result shows that ICMO is competitive compared to these five metaheuristics in solving this practical problem. The result shows that the range between the best and worst metaheuristics in this problem is narrow as it represents the integer-based problem. © (2024), (International Association of Engineers).

The tsunami wave arrived in the coastal areas approximately half an hour after the collapse. As a tsunami wave can travel abruptly, an early warning system should warn faster. However, a warning system based on a sophisticated hydrodynamic model in real-time would take time to conduct the numerical tsunami wave simulation. Hence, this study proposes a fast and reliable estimation of tsunami wave propagation through a classic ray tracing analysis. We use two ray-tracing methods to investigate the tsunami wave propagation from Anak Krakatau to the western Banten Sea. The first method follows Snell's law, considering dispersive waves, and the second assumes non-dispersive waves based on the ray tracing equations, considering the Earth's sphericity. Both methods are quantitatively evaluated by comparing the travel time measured at Anyer and Marina Jambu. This study finds that non-dispersive wave tracing performs a shorter computational time and slightly better prediction of tsunami wave propagation than dispersive-based wave tracing, with a relative absolute difference of the travel time of 17.9–26.7% in Anyer and 3.6–5.2% in Marina Jambu. This study also confirms the importance of bathymetry validity in wave ray tracing. Two regional bathymetry datasets with a mean difference of less than 5 m result in different wave ray tracing, in which one dataset does not produce the wave ray path towards the Panaitan Island. Based on bathymetric surveys in Anyer and Marina Jambu, the national bathymetry data (BATNAS) has shown its superiority to being used as a bathymetry in the ray-tracing process, with correlations of 81% and 93% in both areas compared to other available bathymetry datasets. We summarize that reliable bathymetry data and the non-dispersive ray tracing method can be used as an initial estimation of tsunami wave propagation efficiently. © 2024"

In this study, we examined why the Lato Lato toy uses two balls with the same mass rather than balls with different masses. The collision of the two Lato Lato balls can be considered an elastic collision. The two balls move symmetrically at the same velocity and form a semi-circular route with opposing motion directions when we use Lato Lato with the same ball mass ( m 2 = m 1 ). The angular momentum of the two balls is also the same but in opposite directions, so they cancel each other out. Hence, the two balls travel steadily when Lato Lato is performed. This condition leads to a balanced movement of the Lato Lato system and prevents it from collapsing. On the other hand, because of their disparate masses ( m 2 > m 1 ), the two balls of Lato Lato move in an imbalanced manner. A lighter ball travels farther because it moves more quickly than a heavier ball. The angular momentum of the two balls is in opposite directions but not of the same magnitude, so they do not cancel each other out. This results in unstable movement of the two balls when Lato Lato is played. Therefore, the two balls no longer collide centrally, like in Lato Lato, with the same mass, but the collision is glancing. Then, the motion of the two balls facilitates collapse easily. This work can enrich students’ understanding of collisions beyond the collisions of two objects commonly discussed in textbooks. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd."

The involvement of experts is considered very necessary in the process of diagnosing heart disease, considering its complex nature and potential severity. Machine Learning Algorithms have emerged as powerful tools capable of effectively predicting and detecting heart diseases, thereby reducing the challenges associated with their diagnosis. Notable examples of such algorithms include Extreme Learning Machine Algorithms and Adaptive Boosting, both of which represent Machine Learning techniques adapted for classification purposes. This research tries to introduce a new approach that relies on the use of one parameter. Through careful optimization of algorithm parameters, there is a marked improvement in the accuracy of machine learning predictions, a phenomenon that underscores the importance of parameter tuning in this domain. In this research, the Heart Failure dataset serves as the focal point, with the aim of demonstrating the optimal level of accuracy that can be achieved through the use of Machine Learning algorithms. The results of this study show an average accuracy of 0.83 for the Extreme Learning Machine Algorithm and 0.87 for Adaptive Boosting, the standard deviation for both methods is “0.83±0.02” for Extreme Machine Learning Algorithm and “0.87±0.03” for Adaptive Boosting thus highlighting the efficacy of these algorithms in the context of heart disease prediction. In particular, entering the Learning Rate parameter into Adaboost provides better results when compared with the previous algorithm. Our research findings underline the supremacy of Extreme Learning Machine Algorithms and Adaptive Improvement, especially when combined with the introduction of a single parameter, it can be seen that the addition of parameters results in increased accuracy performance when compared to previous research using standard methods alone. © 2024, Jurusan Teknik Elektromedik, Politeknik Kesehatan Kemenkes Surabaya, Indonesia.

In this study, iron oxide was incorporated with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to create a nanocomposite material for photocatalysis. The interaction between carbon and iron oxide is to investigate to improve the efficiency and stability of nanocomposites as photocatalysts. This nanocomposite is made by depositing MWCNTs on an iron sheet after being oxidized at 400 °C for 60 or 120 minutes. By using a spin coating technique, carbon nanotubes weighing between 0.15 and 0.50 mg were coated on the iron oxide that is formed after the oxidation process. The morphological and structural characteristics of this nanocomposite are characterized using different characterization techniques, including Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Based on the XRD analysis, the α-Fe2O3 structure was formed and FESEM images have shown that MWCNTs were successfully deposited onto the surface of α-Fe2O3 nanoleaves. When the photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposite was examined using aqueous methyl orange (MO), it was discovered that the quantity of MWCNTs deposited on the α-Fe2O3 nanoleaves affected the effectiveness of MO dye. After five hours of exposure, a composite with 0.25 mg of MWCNTs demonstrated superior photocatalytic activity, degrading MO dye by 64%. On the surface of the nanocomposite, MWCNTs aid in the production of reactive radical species like OH• and O2• and lessen the recombination of photo-generated charge carriers. Because of this synergistic mechanism, the photocatalytic process is more efficient, which makes iron oxide nanocomposite a practical material for a range of environmental application. © 2024, Microscopy Society of Malaysia.

However, meeting these requirements poses a significant challenge due to the high costs associated with maintaining digital infrastructure, employee wages, and cybersecurity expenses. Fortunately, Blockchain smart contracts present an economical and secure solution for managing digital infrastructure. They offer a pay-per-transaction schema, immutable transaction records, and role-based data updates. Despite these advantages, public blockchains raise concerns about data privacy since records are publicly readable. To address this issue, this study proposes a privacy-preserving mechanism for public facilities' reservation systems. The approach involves encrypting the reservation table with fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE). By employing FHE with binary masking and polynomial evaluation, the reservation table can be updated without decrypting the data. Consequently, citizens can discreetly book facilities without revealing their identities and eliminating the risk of overlapping schedules. The proposed system allows anyone to verify reservations without disclosing requested data and table contents. Moreover, the system operates autonomously without the need for human administration, ensuring enhanced user privacy. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved."

Moreover, the dynamics of the SEIR model depend on several factors, such as the parameter values. Objective: This study aimed to compare two optimization methods, namely genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), in estimating the SEIR model parameter values, such as the infection, transition, recovery, and death rates. Methods: GA and PSO algorithms were compared to estimate parameter values of the SEIR model. The fitness value was calculated from the error between the actual data of cumulative positive COVID-19 cases and the numerical data of cases from the solution of the SEIR COVID-19 model. Furthermore, the numerical solution of the COVID-19 model was calculated using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm (RK-4), while the actual data were obtained from the cumulative dataset of positive COVID-19 cases in the province of Jakarta, Indonesia. Two datasets were then used to compare the success of each algorithm, namely, Dataset 1, representing the initial interval for the spread of COVID-19, and Dataset 2, representing an interval where there was a high increase in COVID-19 cases. Results: Four parameters were estimated, namely the infection rate, transition rate, recovery rate, and death rate, due to disease. In Dataset 1, the smallest error of GA method, namely 8.9%, occurred when the value of = 0.5, while the numerical error of PSO was 7.5%. In Dataset 2, the smallest error of GA method, namely 31.21%, occurred when = 0.5, while the numerical error of PSO was 3.46%. Conclusion: Based on the parameter estimation results for Datasets 1 and 2, PSO had better fitting results than GA. This showed PSO was more robust to the provided datasets and could better adapt to the trends of the COVID-19 epidemic. © 2024 The Authors. Published by Universitas Airlangga."

Various new businesses have surfaced with the rise of online marketing (E-Commerce) in response to Covid-19 pandemic. This phenomenon allows recommendation items through a system called Collaborative Filtering (CF), aiming to improve shopping experience of users. Typically, the effectiveness of CF relies on the precise identification of similar profile users by similarity algorithms. Traditional similarity measures are based on the user-item rating matrix. Approximately, four custom ratings (CR) were used along with a new rating formula, termed New Custom Rating (NCR), derived from the popularity of users and items in addition to the original rating. Specifically, NCR optimized recommendation system performance by using the popularity of users and items to determine new ratings value, rather than solely relying on the original rating. Additionally, the formulas improved the representativeness of the new rating values and the accuracy of similarity algorithm calculations. Consequently, the increased accuracy of recommendation system was achieved. The implementation of NCR across four CR algorithms and recommendation system using five public datasets was examined. Consequently, the experimental results showed that NCR significantly increased recommendation system accuracy, as evidenced by reductions in RMSE, MSE, and MAE as well as increasing FCP and Hit Rate. Moreover, by combining the popularity of users and items into rating calculations, NCR improved the accuracy of various recommendation system algorithms reducing RMSE, MSE, and MAE up to 62.10%, 53.62%, 65.97%, respectively, while also increasing FCP and Hit Rate up to 11.89% and 31.42%, respectively. © The Author(s) 2024."

Emerging at any longitude following sunset and typically moving eastward, monitoring the EPBs is essential for space weather services. Using three GNSS receivers positioned at the same latitude (∼0°N) but separated in longitudes (∼9°, ∼16°, and ∼25°) and the 47 MHz Equatorial Atmosphere Radar (EAR) in Indonesia, our study delineates the zonal extent of eastward-traveling post-sunset EPB inducing ionospheric GNSS scintillation. Typically, the scintillation occurrences detected by a ground receiver concentrate between 19 and 01 local time (LT), with a peak incidence observed at 21 LT. Furthermore, an experiment combining EAR observations with GNSS receiver data allowed for the determination of the linear change in the speed of eastward-traveling EPB inducing scintillation during this time period. Interestingly, the longitudinal range of eastward-traveling EPBs increased with higher solar flux (F10.7) levels. Our findings suggest that EPB can induce scintillation up to a longitudinal distance of approximately 25° from the onset location at sunset to the eastern midnight region, particularly in F10.7 ranging from 90 to 150 solar flux units. Moreover, experiments using longitudinally separated GNSS receivers indicated that scintillations during 19–01 LT originate from post-sunset EPBs within a longitudinal range extending 25° to the west. In conclusion, our research provides valuable insight into the ability of eastward-traveling EPB to induce GNSS scintillation within a longitudinal range of 25°, thereby enhancing EPB and scintillation monitoring and prediction in regional space weather services. © 2024.

Initially, the UAV is dispatched in different directions to detect toxic gas leakage on the fly in the smart factory premises. However, due to the UAVs’ concern about smokeless and high-density gas detection capabilities, AGVs are proposed to cooperate with UAVs in the smart factory, especially in the basement areas. Because of their limited computational power, UAVs and AGVs securely transfer sensor data to a nearby multi-access edge computing (MEC) server for processing. A hybrid cryptographic technique and unique data authentication mechanisms are exploited to ensure security while transmitting the data in this proposed scheme. Subsequently, the MEC server automatically triggers an emergency alarm during toxic gas leakage to alert all the employees inside the boundaries of the smart factory. The implementation results exhibit that the proposed scheme can successfully sense toxic gas leakage using UAVs and AGVs, securely transfer the data to the MEC server to process, and enhance the overall quality of service compared with the other existing literature.

This study was conducted to devise a harvest forecasting system that supports decision-making through minimal error rates by comparing double exponential smoothing (DES) and long short-term memory (LSTM) forecasting methods. The efficacy of these methods was assessed through a series of trials, analyzing data collected from 2015 to 2019, comprising 250 datasets. The evaluation focused on two primary metrics: the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and the Root MSE (RMSE), to determine the precision of forecast models. It was observed that the LSTM model outperformed the DES method, yielding a MAPE of 38.99% and an RMSE of 1244.85432, in contrast to the DES method which resulted in a MAPE of 43.49% and an RMSE of 12997.34261, at an alpha level of 0.4 and an optimal beta of 0.1. Given these findings, the LSTM model is recommended for the forecast of ginger yields due to its superior accuracy and lower standard error compared to the DES method. This comparative analysis underscores the importance of selecting appropriate forecasting models to enhance agricultural planning and productivity, particularly in crops with fluctuating yields such as ginger. © 2024 The authors.

This is why regular screenings or health checks are necessary to detect cancer lesions early. Since bone scan images have become the primary means of detecting the emergence of cancer lesions on bone, high segmentation accuracy is essential for establishing the model of some predefined regions in bone scan images where cancer metastasis was predicted to appear. Consequently, robust localization and identification of the specific region in bone scan images are required for automated metastasis detection. To this end, we propose Efficient-BtrflyNet, a new deep learning-based architecture for skeleton segmentation of whole-body bone scan images. The proposed architecture exploits the benefits of EfficientNet’s model scaling and the encoder–decoder design of butterfly-type networks. We added EfficientNetB7 to the encoder section to obtain more specific features. The proposed architecture simultaneously processes anterior and posterior whole-body bone scan images.

Leveraging the strengths of various base models, including random forest, gradient boosting, extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting, our ensemble classifier integrates these diverse predictions using a logistic regression meta-classifier. Our model was evaluated using a comprehensive dataset generated from molecular dynamics simulations. While the gains in AUC and other metrics might seem modest, they contribute to a model that is more robust, consistent, and adaptable. To assess the effectiveness of various approaches, we compared the performance of logistic regression to four baseline models. Our results indicate that logistic regression consistently underperforms across all evaluated metrics. This suggests that it may not be well-suited to capture the complex relationships within this dataset. Tree-based models, on the other hand, appear to be more effective for problems involving molecular dynamics simulations. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and light gradient boosting (LightGBM) are optimized for performance and speed, handling datasets effectively and incorporating regularizations to avoid over-fitting. Our findings indicate that the ensemble method enhances the predictive capability of PPIs, offering a promising tool for computational biology and drug discovery by accurately identifying potential interaction sites and facilitating the understanding of complex protein functions within biological systems. © 2024 by the authors."

This study endeavors to investigate the potential correlation between weather conditions and the incidence of number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in East Java. To achieve this, a nonparametric regression model, specifically, the Negative Binomial Regression (NBR) model based on the least squares spline estimator, was utilized. The outcomes of the study indicate that the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of nonparametic regression model is 0.30. Meanwhile, the MAPE for the parametric regression model is 0.34. The results show that a nonparametric regression model approach is better than parametric regression model approach. The study establishes that the truncated spline estimator based NBR model represents the best fit, with an MLCV value of -256.71. The findings of the study suggest that a temperature less than 21.75ºC is associated with a decrease of 13.28 number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per each 1ºC increase, while a temperature between 21.75ºC and 25.78ºC is linked to an increase of 6.85 number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per each 1ºC increase. In contrast, a temperature greater than 25.78ºC is associated with a decrease of 139.42 number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per each 1ºC increase. Similarly, a wind speed less than 5.57 m/s is related to a decrease of 12.99 number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per each 1 m/s increase, whereas a wind speed between 5.57 m/s and 8.99 m/s is associated with a decrease of 10.29 number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per each 1 m/s increase. Furthermore, a wind speed greater than 8.99 m/s is linked to a decrease of 19.16 number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 per each 1 m/s increase. The study provides evidence that higher temperatures and wind speeds result in a slower rise in the incidence of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. Consequently, it is recommended that the local government remains vigilant during periods of low temperature and wind speed, which may result in a more rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc..

This study provides insight into the temporal and spatial variability of bow echo distribution and presents the atmospheric condition associated with the bow echo events. Temporal analysis is categorical into monthly, seasonally, and diurnal. The analysis was performed using X-band radar network and reanalysis data (ERA5). Result: At least 26 bow echoes were identified across the Bandung basin from X-band radar network during the study period. From this total number of bow echoes, the observation of initiation modes is primarily generated from a weakly organized cell, with few coming from the squall line. The bow echo mostly evolved from noon until afternoon. The rainy season (December–January–February) and transition season (March–April–May) is the most frequent period of bow echo occurrence, with March being the most active month. Nevertheless, this study also found bow echo occurrence in the dry season (June–July–August). For the spatial analysis, the studied area is divided into two regions representing the eastern and western part of Bandung basin. The eastern region recorded the most intense occurrences with 14 events. The movement of bow echo in this region covered a shorter distance (average distance only 4.56 km), with all initiation modes occurring inside the region. The atmospheric condition within this region has less moisture flux, with higher CAPE and slightly higher surface temperature. Meanwhile, in the western region have different characteristics with higher moisture flux, a slight effect of CAPE and CINH, with longer distance and zonal movement direction of bow echo displacement. Conclusion: These conditions indicate that local convection is the dominant mode of bow echo initiation mode in the eastern region of Bandung basin. Meanwhile, the monsoon effect influences the bow echo initiation mode in the western region. Given that the observed 4-year bow echo has different characteristics from previous studies of bow echo in mid latitudes, developing different criteria for bow echo detection in the tropics is crucial. © The Author(s) 2024."

Many past studies throughout the decades, in machine learning approaches, were non-generalizable and needed more accuracy. Therefore, this study aims to introduce nonparametric predictive inference (NPI) with a parametric copula, which considers the dependence structure to predict the forest fire hotspots using the coordinate - longitude and latitude. The proposed method was theorized to perform better than the current models and be able to generalize in other regions with the same parameters. A case study of Malaysia was chosen as there was a lack of mathematical and statistical solutions in forest fire management in this country. The four copulae integrated with the proposed method generated imprecise probabilities with a minimal gap showing the forecasting accuracy.

Traditional FL optimizations, which typically focus on a single aspect, fall short in IIoT environments. Our approach integrates a multi-criteria enhancement: first, an Ensembled Client Selection Mechanism (ECSM) selects participants based on accuracy, reputation, and randomness. Second, Adaptive Distributed Client Training (ADCT) dynamically adjusts based on participant performance. Lastly, a Secure and Efficient Communication Channel (SECC), backed by blockchain, meets IIoT's stringent security demands. The evaluation shows TSFed outperforms baseline methods, enhancing FL performance by increasing accuracy and F1-score. Importantly, TSFed improves the efficiency of achieving 80% accuracy on the MNIST dataset by 29.09% over baseline methods, showcasing significant gains in both security and efficiency. This mechanism also exhibits robustness against malicious attacks, setting a new benchmark for FL in IIoT environments. © 2024"

In this study, a glassy carbon electrode was successfully modified by incorporating ZnO-PVA-Graphene nanocomposite, leveraging the excellent electrical properties and electron mobility of the material. Comprehensive material analysis, including XRD, confirmed that ZnO maintained its hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure despite the addition of graphene. Moreover, FESEM analysis showed that increasing graphene concentration led to a reduction in ZnO particle size by 85, 68, and 52 nm, respectively, accompanied by a decrease in band gap energy, as verified by UV–Vis measurements. Photoluminescence tests were also conducted and the result showed a noticeable blue shift in ZnO-PVA-Graphene nanocomposites compared to ZnO-PVA, specifically in the near band-edge (NBE) UV emission within the 374–379 nm wavelength range. Through I–V characterization, the optimal graphene concentration for cadmium detection was identified as 1.5 wt% in ZnO-PVA-Graphene nanocomposites, showing an approximate ohmic response. Meanwhile, square-wave voltammetry analysis of cadmium concentrations ranging from 0 to 80 ppm produced a coefficient of determination of 0.98926 and a Limit of Detection (LOD) of 9.88 ppm. These results showed the significant potential of ZnO-PVA-Graphene nanocomposites as a promising material for further development as an effective electrode modifier, enhancing the sensitivity of detection systems. © 2024 The Authors"

Implementing measures to prevent such floods becomes crucial, offering inhabitants ample time to evacuate vulnerable areas before flood events occur. In addressing the flood issue, numerous scholars have put forth various solutions, such as the development of fuzzy system models and the establishment of suitable infrastructure. However, when applying a fuzzy system, it often results in a loss of interpretability of the fuzzy rules. To address this issue effectively, we propose to reframe the optimization problem by incorporating stage costs alongside the terminal cost. Results show the proposed model called hybrid fuzzy logic and neural networks (NNs) can mitigate the loss of interpretability. Results also show that the proposed method was employed in a flood early detection system aligned with integrating into Twitter social media.

The nominal ionospheric gradient is generally obtained from Continuously Operating Reference Stations data by using the spatial single-difference method (mixed-pair, station-pair, or satellite-pair) or the temporal single-difference method (time-step). The time-step method uses only a single receiver, but it still contains ionospheric temporal variations. We introduce a corrected time-step method using a fixed-ionospheric pierce point from the geostationary equatorial orbit satellite and test it through simulations based on the global ionospheric model. We also investigate the effect of satellite paths on the corrected time-step method in the region of the equator, which tends to be in a more north–south direction and to have less coverage for the east–west ionospheric gradient. This study also addresses the limitations of temporal variation correction coverage and recommends using only the correction from self-observations. All processes are developed under simulations because observational data are still difficult to obtain.

Through a series of assumptions, this model can be formulated and subsequently validated against real-world conditions. Leveraging the abundance of COVID-19 data presently available, this study endeavors to reverse engineer the model construction process. Specifically, we analyse the compartmental model governing two notable variants of COVID-19: Delta and Omicron, utilizing empirical data. Employing the SINDy method, we extract parameters that define the model by effectively fitting the available data. To ensure robustness, the obtained model undergoes validation via comparison with real-world data through numerical integration. Additionally, we conduct fine-tuning in regularization techniques and input features to refine model selection.

When the obstacle detection system used in wheelchairs fails to accurately identify descending stairs, it can lead to severe consequences for users, including injuries or, in the worst-case scenario, fatal accidents. Therefore, there is a pressing need for an algorithm that not only exhibits high accuracy in detecting obstacles on descending stairs but also operates with minimal computational delay to ensure an immediate response in wheelchair braking. In this research, We utilize the GLCM technique to extract texture characteristics. Out of these methods, the Decision Tree exhibits the highest accuracy, reaching 94%, with a remarkably fast computational time of 0.01299 s. These promising results were achieved by utilizing the GLCM method with a distance of 2 and an angle of 45°. The accuracy obtained has increased by 2.5% compared to the previous research. Such a level of accuracy, coupled with fast computational performance, enables smart wheelchairs to effectively assist users in identifying obstacles while descending stairs. © 2024"

The southern surge, which coincided with the MJO, enhanced rainfall in the western research region, with Yogyakarta seeing the greatest increase at 4.69 mm/day. Meanwhile, the southern surge that occurred without the MJO increased rainfall in the eastern region, with West Nusa Tenggara seeing the greatest rise at 3.09 mm/day. However, the southerly surge has the effect of lowering rainfall in Jakarta, reaching −2.21 mm/day when the MJO is active and −1.58 mm/day when the MJO is inactive. The southerly surge causes extreme rainfall to only occur in a small part of certain areas, so it tends to significantly reduce the possibility of extreme rainfall. In the southern part of the Indonesian maritime continent, the southerly surge predominates over the MJO, supporting increased water vapor transport. Rainfall mostly increases in the afternoon and decreases in the morning when the southerly surge occurs, whether there is the MJO or not.

DNN, a subset of machine learning techniques, has been found to improve ransomware detection and classification precision and efficacy. Ransomware has been affecting commercial, public, and governmental organizations' networks and computer systems for more than a decade, enabling new dynamic detection techniques to help DNNs detect ransomware. However, deep neural network-based architectures and DL classifiers (such as DNN, and Bi-LSTM classifiers) will be employed to detect ransomware. These networks may learn to correctly identify and categorize new ransomware incidents by integrating various datasets, including known and unknown ransomware samples. The classification of ransomware detection has been thoroughly investigated, and a model incorporating classic DL techniques with DNN and Bi-LSTM-based architecture will be proposed. A model execution experiment will be carried out to facilitate comparative testing of various approaches. This study focuses on the detection and classification of ransomware using DNN and Bi-LSTM.

Hence, in this paper, we develop e-commerce data and machine learning algorithms as a proxy for poverty levels that can provide faster information than surveys or censuses. The e-commerce dataset is used and this high-dimensional data becomes a challenge. Hence, feature selection algorithms are employed to determine the best features before building a machine learning model. Furthermore, three machine learning algorithms such as support vector regression, linear regression, and k-nearest neighbor are compared to predict the poverty rate. Hence, the contribution of this paper is to propose the combination of statistical-based feature selection and machine learning algorithms to predict the poverty rate based on e-commerce data.

However, as a result of the amount of data collected, there will be an information explosion as well as the possibility of information redundancy. One of the methods targeted at supporting the input query in locating the required or relevant information is the search system. In weighing to measure statistics from a collection of papers on the search for information about the Covid 19 vaccine on tempo news, the approaches TF-IDF and VSM (Vector Space Model) are used, followed by tokenizing the text to split it, stopword removal, or filtering to remove extraneous words like conjunctions and others. The next process is sentence stemming, which aims to reduce word inflection to its most basic form. News document 1 (DOC 1) has a weight of 17.242, news document 5 (DOC 5) has a weight of 11.687, news document 4 (DOC 4) has a weight of 9.243, news document 2 (DOC 2) has a weight of 5.737, and news document 3 (DOC 3) has a weight of 0. The precision with which a document's word weighting is calculated can be determined using the Term Frequency (TF) - Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) approach and Vector Space Model.  © 2024 Author(s)."

RGO has novel mechanics in shifting the random motion into a guided motion strategy during the iteration. In RGO, the iteration is divided into three equal size phases. In the first phase, the unit walks randomly inside the search space to tackle the local optimal problem earlier. In the second phase, each unit uses a unit selected randomly among the population as a reference in conducting the guided motion. In the third phase, each unit conducts guided motion toward or surpasses the best unit. Through simulation, RGO successfully finds the acceptable solution for 23 benchmark functions. Moreover, RGO successfully finds the global optimal solution for four functions: Branin, Goldstein-Price, Six Hump Camel, and Schwefel 2.22. RGO also outperforms slime mold algorithm (SMA), pelican optimization algorithm (POA), golden search optimizer (GSO), and northern goshawk optimizer (NGO) in solving 12, 20, 12, and 1 function consecutively. In the future, improvement can be made by transforming RGO into solid multiple-phase strategy without losing its identity as a metaheuristic with multiple strategy in every iteration. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Botnets can steal sensitive information from IoT devices and control them to launch another attack, such as a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack or email spam. This attack is commonly detected using a network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that monitors the network device’s activity. However, IoT network is dynamic and IoT devices have many types with different configurations and vendors in IoT environments. Therefore, this research proposes an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) by ensemble-ing traffic from heterogeneous IoT devices. This research proposes Deep Neural Network (DNN) to create a training model from each heterogeneous IoT device. After that, each training model from each heterogeneous IoT device is used to predict the traffic. The prediction results from each training model are averaged using the ensemble averaging method to determine the final result. This research used the N-BaIoT dataset to validate the proposed IDS model.

This study examines the validity of rational bubbles in stock market prices, focusing on eight African stock markets: South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, Morocco, Mauritius, Ghana, and Botswana. Utilizing newly developed econophysics-based unit root tests and the Dynamic Conditional Correlation Multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (DCC MGARCH) models, the authors analyzed daily data from 1996 to 2022. Our findings indicate that these markets experienced bubbles at various points, often followed by bursts. These bubbles coincided with significant economic changes, suggesting a strong link between stock market behavior and economic growth. For instance, financial crises, political instability, and global economic downturns significantly influenced bubble formation and bursts in these markets. The study reveals that market-specific events, such as regulatory changes and shifts in investor sentiment, also contributed to the occurrence of bubbles. Three key policy options are proposed to address bubbles in the studied markets including, enhancing regulatory frameworks to monitor and mitigate bubble formation, improving financial literacy among investors to promote informed decision-making, and strengthening economic policies to stabilize macroeconomic conditions and reduce vulnerability to external shocks. By implementing these measures, policymakers can enhance market stability and foster sustainable economic growth in African stock markets. © 2024 by the authors."

There are many methods which can be used to analyze mixture formation and flame propagation of biofuel. This study using common method which known as Z-type Schlieren method to investigate the optical visualization systems and analyze both mixture formation and flame propagation of biofuel and to prove that they are suitable to be used to determine the biofuel combustion characteristics. The biofuel used in this study are premix of ethanol-gasoline and methanol-gasoline where each premix consists of 5%, 10% and 15% vol. blend ratio of alcohol in gasoline. These biofuels then were tested in three different ambient pressure inside the combustion chamber which are 0.4MPa, 0.5MPa and 0.6MPa. The higher the ambient pressure results to fastest flame propagation. Besides that, at higher ambient pressures, the use of ethanol-gasoline as an alternate fuel can lower the exhaust emissions produced by spark ignition engines compared to methanol-gasoline.

This technology plays a crucial role in facilitating the transition from conventional to precision agriculture, particularly in the context of weed control. Precision agriculture, which previously relied on manual efforts, has now embraced the use of smart devices for more efficient weed detection. However, several challenges are associated with weed detection, including the visual similarity between weed and crop, occlusion and lighting effects, as well as the need for early-stage weed control. Therefore, this study aimed to provide a comprehensive review of the application of both traditional machine learning and deep learning, as well as the combination of the two methods, for weed detection across different crop fields. The results of this review show the advantages and disadvantages of using machine learning and deep learning. Generally, deep learning produced superior accuracy compared to machine learning under various conditions. Machine learning required the selection of the right combination of features to achieve high accuracy in classifying weed and crop, particularly under conditions consisting of lighting and early growth effects. Moreover, a precise segmentation stage would be required in cases of occlusion. Machine learning had the advantage of achieving real-time processing by producing smaller models than deep learning, thereby eliminating the need for additional GPUs.

Heart sounds can help support healthcare workers by aiding in the early diagnosis of irregular heart rhythms. This study developed a system to categorize heart sounds by employing logistic regression as the classifier and the grey-level co-occurrence matrix as the classifier. For this reason, the GLCM technique was assessed in this work for feature extraction in the heart sound categorization. Moreover, the diagnostic heart sound analysis and classification procedure can be greatly improved by visualizing heart sounds using the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). The three data classifications for heart sounds are artifact, murmurs, and normal. Moreover, the heart sound is converted into the time-frequency domain using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The gray-level co-occurrence matrix approach is a useful tool for extracting the energy distribution in STFT. Dissimilarity, correlation, homogeneity, contrast, energy, and angular second moment (ASM) are the characteristics of the GLCM extraction. With dissimilarity offering the most feature extraction, logistic regression yields an 82% classification accuracy. The AUC value of 0.7 for the murmur class indicated that the feature and classification model had reduced sensitivity, but it performed well for the normal and artifact classes.

The conversion of two student dormitory buildings into isolation shelters is expected to accommodate COVID-19 patients who do not have rooms in the hospital. This requires specific planning and innovation, particularly for materials. This study has two objectives: first, to evaluate how long coronaviruses can remain active on different material surfaces. The data collection strategy was carried out through Systematic Review. The second research objective was to design a COVID-19 isolation room that uses materials that facilitate the healing process. Field surveys and traditional literature reviews were conducted for this purpose. This study found that the virus did not survive long on the surfaces of cotton and cardboard. Thus, the room design uses these materials and is considered a biophilic design. This study is expected to provide insights for academics and researchers in interior design and architecture regarding the knowledge of furniture materials that prevent viruses from surviving longer. In addition, it is expected to inspire interior designers to design rooms that can help the healing process using a biophilic approach. © (2024), (Universiti Putra Malaysia Press).

It is also necessary to determine the appropriate investor profile according to the conditions of a country. This protects investors from major losses. Therefore, there is a strong need for a new study that analyzes the risk profiles of derivative products in emerging economies. This study aims to identify the most appropriate investor risk profile for derivative instruments in emerging economies. It constructs a novel decision-making model. In this model, the facial action coding system, quantum theory, spherical fuzzy sets, and multi-stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (M-SWARA) methodology are integrated to minimize uncertainty in this process. First, three main participants of derivatives for financial technology investors are evaluated using the quantum spherical fuzzy M-SWARA technique. After that, seven emerging economies are ranked based on this performance using quantum spherical fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution. The main contribution is that an appropriate investor profile is identified for financial derivative investments in emerging economies. One of the important originalities of this study is the development of a new technique called M-SWARA by making some improvements to the classical stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis method. It is concluded that hedging is the most appropriate purpose for making investments in derivative products in emerging economies. It is also identified that China has the greatest performance among the seven emerging economies regarding the appropriate purpose for making derivative investments. For the effective management of this problem in these countries, it is recommended to prevent the speculative use of derivative products with legal regulations. © 2024, The Author(s)."

Even though these cities are located side-by-side, each city has different characteristics. Bandung has many hotels and culinary spots, meanwhile, Lembang has many scenery spots. Tourists usually have limited time to visit all the destinations on holiday, which makes them choose several destinations. This paper proposes a tourism itinerary recommendation system based on the calculation of the most optimal route between destinations using the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). Later, the optimal route is defined using the shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra). Data for the algorithm came from the collaboration between the several road information and criteria weights that are determined using the analytics hierarchy process (AHP). According to the simulation, the criteria weights are 6.9%, 62.7%, 18.6%, and 11.9% for route length, traffic condition, travel time, and weather condition, respectively. Moreover, the optimal number of tourism itinerary plans is 4 destinations. As the usage of computational resources, it takes 31.8% and 61.9% of CPU and memory usage. The time processing increases exponentially as the increment of the number of requested stops.

However, the precision may get compromised by the chronic phenomenon of micromachining called ploughing. Ploughing produces extra roughness, as some cut surfaces are ploughed by the cutting tool. It is expected that any disruption to these continuous interactions could mitigate this unwanted condition. Therefore, Ultrasonic Assisted Vibration Turning (UVAT) was proposed, utilizing its intermittent cutting to reduce the contact between the cutting tool and the workpiece. In this study, the impact of Longitudinal (LVAT) and Tangential (TVAT) UVAT on surface roughness in micro turning of aluminium alloy was investigated. The experimental data suggests that LVAT and TVAT affect differently on reducing the surface roughness of the micro-turned Al-6061. However, LVAT proves to be more effective in suppressing the negative effects of ploughing at high feed rate cuttings, as indicated by a smoother machined surface. LVAT reduced surface roughness by 12% greater than TVAT at a cutting feed rate of 0.48 mm/rev. These findings support the potential of UVAT, particularly the LVAT technique, as a viable approach to enhance surface quality in micro turning applications for precision engineering. © 2024, Penerbit Akademia Baru.

Magnetic sensing has particularly gained attention among the innovative non-destructive evaluation techniques. Recently, the embedded magnetic shape memory alloy (MSMA) wire has been introduced for the evaluation of cracks in concrete components through magnetic sensing techniques while providing reinforcement as well. However, the available research in this regard is very scarce. This study has focused on the analyses of parameters affecting the magnetic sensing capability of embedded MSMA wire for crack detection in concrete beams. The response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models have been used to analyse the magnetic sensing parameters for the first time. The models were trained using the experimental data obtained through literature. The models aimed to predict the alteration in magnetic flux created by a concrete beam that has a 1 mm wide embedded MSMA wire after experiencing a fracture or crack. The results showed that the change in magnetic flux was affected by the position of the wire and the position of the crack with respect to the position of the magnet in the concrete beam. RSM optimisation results showed that maximum change in magnetic flux was obtained when the wire was placed at a depth of 17.5 mm from the top surface of the concrete beam, and a crack was present at an axial distance of 8.50 mm from the permanent magnet. The change in magnetic flux was 9.50 % considering the aforementioned parameters. However, the ANN prediction results showed that the optimal wire and crack position were 10 mm and 1.1 mm, respectively. The results suggested that a larger beam requires a larger diameter of MSMA wire or multiple sensors and magnets for crack detection in concrete beams. © 2024 The Authors"

To address this, the study proposes a novel redesign of the control system for the hammer mill machine, particularly in the panel section, using the waterfall design methodology. This strategic redesign has led to the implementation of an advanced automation system, which significantly streamlines the process by automatically displaying time and power consumption data on the HMI display. This enhancement not only simplifies monitoring and control, but also substantially boosts efficiency. The results show a reduction in the hammer mill machine's operating time by 13 seconds, an increase in productivity by 48%, and reveal power consumption details for the motor and conveyor bucket.

Moreover, lecturers should write quality scientific articles productively so that AI-based software can facilitate writing. Therefore, this research explores the driving and inhibiting factors that are thought to influence the use of AI-based software to assist lecturers in writing scientific articles. Following its goals, this research identified the potential factors through six hypotheses and tested them using PLS-SEM. This research recruited 110 lecturers in Indonesia as respondents to express their quantitative perceptions. It found that Product Quality (QLT) and Security (SEC) factors influence lecturers' use of AI-based software in scientific writing.

The finding exposed software quality has a vital role in engaging lecturers' intention to use AI-based software considering its characteristics to satisfy their needs: usefulness, easiness, accuracy, and efficiency. Also, lecturers are concerned with information security since AI-based software captures personal data, including user behavior during its usage.

To solve this problem, we developed a BP prediction system that merges extracted features of PPG and ECG from two pulses of both signals using convolutional and LSTM layers, followed by incorporating the R-to-R interval durations as additional features for predicting systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure. Our findings indicate that the prediction accuracies for SBP and DBP were 5.306 ± 7.248 mmHg with a 0.877 correlation coefficient and 3.296 ± 4.764 mmHg with a 0.918 correlation coefficient, respectively. We found that our proposed model achieved a robust performance on the MIMIC III dataset with a minimum architectural design and high-level accuracy compared to existing methods.

This research focuses on changes in extreme rainfall that result in natural disasters. Indonesia, as a country with a tropical climate, certainly has its characteristics regarding rainfall patterns, such as air temperatures that tend to be high, sunlight that occurs throughout the year, and low air pressure. The characteristics of the tropical climate will form patterns and allow natural disasters to occur. Losses due to natural disasters can be minimized if there is thorough preparation in dealing with the possibility of natural disasters. Thorough preparation in facing natural disasters is based on knowledge of predictions of when and where the natural disaster will occur. Changes in rainfall can be predicted based on past rainfall data. These data produce patterns, such as real-time intensity. The data used in this research comes from the himawari-8 satellite using a cloud dataset. The next stage is pre-processing, which is the cleaning and adjustment of data. The deep learning algorithms used in this research are long short-term memory (LSTM) and recurrent neural network (RNN) to manage time series data. In previous research, it has been recommended that LSTM and RNN algorithms be used for rainfall prediction. The system created in this research is a rainfall prediction model using python programming language analysis and system output in the form of software with the accuracy of the LSTM model reaching 92.62% and the RNN model reaching 89.38%. © 2024, Innovative Information Science and Technology Research Group.

Traditional methods often need more agility and user-friendliness, leading to delays and inaccuracies. This research aims to verify a fast and agile student medical report that we have previously developed using the Modified Agile User Experience (UX) method, with a focus on simplicity, usability, and accessibility. The system’s evaluation employs non-functional testing methods to identify factors influencing user satisfaction within the scope of the user experience. We measure task-level and overall user satisfaction using the Single Ease Questions (SEQ) questionnaire as the response variable. This study also investigates test-level satisfaction as predictor variables using Usability Metric for User Experience (UMUX) and UMUX-Lite questionnaire as predictor variables, as well as each student’s Interest in learning and learning motivation concerning test-level satisfaction. Binary Logistic Regression (BLR) analysis determined the relationship between test-level and task-level satisfaction, revealing significant correlations between these variables. Based on the results, the Interest to Learn variable is the most important factor that influences task-level satisfaction, but with a small probability value (42.9%). To ensure these accurate results, we changed the scale on SEQ from Easy and Hard to seven scales with normalized values. We compared the results using 4 algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting as the most effective model. For a test size of 0.2 and a random state of 40, Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 0.80 and a Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) and Area Under Curve (AUC) score of 0.83. Random Forest also had an accuracy of 0.80 but a slightly lower ROC AUC score of 0.77. SVM also performed well, with accuracies of 0.83 and ROC AUC scores of 0.77. Gradient Boosting showed the lowest performance with an accuracy of 0.77 and a ROC AUC score of 0.73. These results indicate that Logistic Regression is the most robust model for predicting user satisfaction. Significant data correlations between SEQ, UMUX, and UMUX-Lite guide the development of user-centered applications, enhancing the effectiveness of educational tools by ensuring higher user satisfaction. Future research should consider more extensive, more diverse samples and additional factors influencing user experience to refine these models and their applications. © Authors retain all copyrights."

The nomenclature reflects its reliance on the best member, which is amalgamated with other entities. BOA, a metaphor-free swarm-based metaheuristic, comprises three directed searches. The first involves subtracting the best member from a randomly selected member. The second entails determining the midpoint between the best member, and another randomly chosen member. The third centers around the midpoint between the best member and a random solution along the space. The efficacy of BOA is evaluated by challenging it to solve a collection of 23 functions. In this evaluation, BOA is pitted against five other metaheuristics: Northern Goshawk Optimization (NGO), Zebra Optimization Algorithm (ZOA), Coati Optimization Algorithm (COA), Migration Algorithm (MA), and Osprey Optimization Algorithm (OOA). The findings indicate the superiority of BOA over its counterparts. BOA outperforms NGO, ZOA, COA, MA, and OOA in 21, 15, 16, 15, and 17 functions, respectively. These results underscore the pivotal role of the best member as a reference and the comparatively lesser significance of the neighborhood search as the search space diminishes during the iteration. © (2024), (International Association of Engineers).

Instead of clustering admission in one period directly, this paper tried to analyze the movement of clustering membership from one period to another. We observed the movement membership of the group from three categories period, such as monthly, quarterly, and semesterly. The experimental results demonstrate that the monthly scenario was the best clustering result. The monthly scenario achieves the best score for all metrics such as the Dunn index, Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, and Calinski-Harabasz compared to the quarter and semester scenario.

The model describes the optimal productions and allocations in normal and disrupted conditions. The objective function is to minimize the total supply chain cost and emissions. To handle the complexity, we proposed a priority-based Non-dominating Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (pb-NSGA-II) and priority-based Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (pb-MOPSO) with four novel decoding procedures to accommodate the priority: ordering cost, carbon emission, backtrack priority-based decoding, and adaptive decoding.

Currently, e-learning plays a pivotal role in higher education because of the shift in the educational paradigm from a teacher-centered approach to a student-centered approach. The criteria utilized in multiple sets of heuristics for evaluating e-learning are carefully examined based on the definitions of each criterion. If there are similarities in meaning among these criteria, they are consolidated into a single criterion, resulting in the creation of 20 new criteria (spanning three primary aspects) for the evaluation of e-learning. These 20 new criteria encompass key aspects related to the user interface, learning development, and motivation. Each aspect is assigned a weight to facilitate prioritization when implementing improvements to evaluate e-learning, which is especially beneficial for institutions with limited resources responsible for the relevant units. In terms of weighting, there is room for enhancement to attain more optimal weighting outcomes by employing a Fuzzy Preference Programming method known as Inverse Trigonometric Fuzzy Preference Programming (ITFPP). The higher the assigned weight, the greater the priority for implementing improvements. © 2024 by the authors."

However, the implementation risks interference because of transmitting and/or receiving radar signals from/to other vehicles. This interference will increase the floor noise that can mask the target signal. This paper proposes multiplicative-adaptive filtering and Hilbert transform to mitigate the interference effect and maintain the target signal detectability. The method exploited the trade-off between the step-size and sidelobe effect on the least mean square-based adaptive filtering to improve the target detection accuracy, especially in the long-range case. The numerical analysis on the millimeter-wave frequency modulated continuous wave radar with multiple interferers concluded that the proposed method could maintain and enhance the target signal even if the target range is relatively far from the victim radar. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Traditional methods of assessing tea quality rely on subjective sensory evaluation by expert panels, which can be time-consuming, expensive, and prone to biases. In recent years, electronic nose (e-nose) technology has emerged as a promising and objective approach to tea quality assessment. This study investigates the application of e-nose technology for the automated and objective assessment of Gambung green tea quality, especially for noninfused (dry) tea aroma. Using noninfused tea has advantages because it does not require a long preparation procedure such as brewing and does not damage the tea sample, so it can be used repeatedly. However, this also has its challenges due to the less strong tea aroma making it more difficult to identify. Machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter optimization (HPO) were utilized to evaluate their performance in classification and regression tasks. The k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm achieved the highest accuracy and provided reliable confusion matrix results. Moreover, the k-NN algorithm outperformed other approaches in predicting organoleptic scores, with the highest R-squared score and the lowest mean squared error values. In summary, this study demonstrates the potential of e-nose technology coupled with optimized machine learning algorithms for the noninfused aroma-based identification of Gambung green tea. However, improvements are required to enhance the performance of organoleptic score predictions. This study contributes to the understanding and application of e-nose technology in tea quality assessment, opening ways for further progress in this area.  © 2001-2012 IEEE."

One widely used method of recommender systems is Collaborative Filtering (CF). The CF method bases predictions for a user on feedback data from other users, so that user preferences can be formulated based on the feedback it provides. One of the prevalent obstacles to the CF method is that the feedback data is often incomplete because there is no compulsion for the user to provide feedback on the items they have consumed. Incomplete data will affect the quality of recommendation results. One way to address this is to use missing data imputation. In this study, a collaborative filtering method is proposed where missing data imputation is carried out first before commencing data training.

This study was focused on produce second-generation bioethanol using a new pretreatment process. The effectiveness of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pretreatment on oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) for lignin removal, reducing sugar, and bioethanol production at low temperature and pressure was investigated using batch and continuous processes. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the NaOH concentration and solid to liquor ratio (SL) at a maximum temperature of 100 °C and atmospheric pressure. The mathematical formula derived from RSM was based on 11 runs of the batch treatment. In the batch treatment process, 2 M NaOH, the temperature of 80 °C, and SL ratio of 8 have resulted in lignin removal of 38.7%, reducing sugars of 8.3%, and bioethanol concentration of 4.1%. The validation of formula has been calculated from calculation and experiment values. Moreover, at the same retention time, continuous pretreatment showed a reducing sugar content of 5.9% and a bioethanol concentration by 2.5%. The results show that the continuous process can be employed in effective bioethanol production from OPEFB.

SFCA uses swarm intelligence as its primary technique and the crossover as its secondary one. It consists of three searches in every iteration. The swarm member walks toward the best member as the first search. The central point of the swarm becomes the target in the second search. There are two walks in the second search. The first walk is getting closer to the target, while the second is avoiding the target. The better result between these two walks becomes the candidate for the replacement. In the third search, the swarm member performs balance arithmetic crossover with the central point of the space or jumps to the opposite location within the area (flipping). The assessment is taken by confronting SFCA with five new metaheuristics: slime mold algorithm (SMA), golden search optimization (GSO), osprey optimization algorithm (OOA), coati optimization algorithm (COA), and walrus optimization algorithm (WaOA) in handling the set of 23 functions.

Current biochemical assays use antibodies (Abs) due to their high specificity and sensitivity. However, there are some limitations, such as the high-cost production of Abs due to complex instruments, reagents, and steps; the variability of Abs quality from batch to batch; the low stability at high temperatures; and the difficulty of chemical modification. Aptamer overcomes the limitations of antibodies, such as relatively lower cost, high reproducibility, high stability, and ease of being chemically modified. Aptamers are three-dimensional architectures of single-stranded RNA or DNA that bind to targets such as proteins. Six aptamers (Tro1-Tro6) with higher binding affinity than an antibody have been identified, but the molecular interaction has not been studied. In this study, six DNA aptamers were modeled and docked to cTnI protein. Molecular docking revealed that the interaction between all aptamer and cTnI happened in the similar cTnI region. The interaction between aptamer and cTnI involved hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonds, π-cation interactions, π-stack interactions, and salt-bridge formation. The calculated binding energy of all complexes was negative, which means that the complex formation was thermodynamically favorable. The electrostatic energy term was the main driving force of the interaction between all aptamer and cTnI. This study could be used to predict the behavior of further modified aptamer to improve aptamer performance. © 2024 Ropii et al.

This paper presents the experimentations on PHP contrived using copper with different inner tube diameters of 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mm, respectively. The PHP is accused of acetone as a functional liquid with filling proportions varying from 50 to 90% of its volume with an increment of 10%. The effects of filling proportion and tube diameter on the thermal performance of PHP were investigated. The evaporator zone is electrically heated using a mica heater in the range of 20–80 W, and the condenser area is kept cool by the water circulation method. The results show that a 2 mm inner tube diameter performs best compared to other tube diameters, with a lower rate of thermal resistance of 0.49 K/W. Also, the performance of PHP is enhanced at a filling proportion of 60% for all the tube diameters. Further, CFD analysis was carried out for different filling ratios for a 2 mm diameter pipe at a constant heat input of 80 W, and it revealed that test outcomes were in line with CFD results. The deviation between the experimental and numerical studies was 10%. Considering the optimized parameters, i.e., tube diameter and filling ratio, the work was extended by adding SiO2 nanoparticles to the base fluid with 1–5 % mass concentration. The results showed a lower thermal resistance value of 0.3 W/K and a higher heat transfer coefficient of 828.64 W/m2 °K was obtained at 2% mass concentration of SiO2. Also, the proportional rise in heat transfer coefficient at 60 W is 11.46, 17, 14, 4.15, and 1.94% for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5% mass concentration of SiO2 nanoparticles, respectively.

A domain-partitioning technique or coupling model would be more practical. This paper reports a numerical study of a landslide-generated wave, which uses a multi-phase CFD model for the landslide phenomena and a surface wave model based on Boussinesq-type equations for wave propagation. The proposed coupling model that sits between the multi-phase CFD and wave models validated by laboratory experiments is shown to be effective.

As its name suggests, HMA offers a new kind of mirroring search. HMA is developed by hybridizing swarm intelligence and the evolution system. Swarm intelligence is adopted by constructing several autonomous agents called swarms. On the other hand, the evolution system is adopted using arithmetic crossover based on a particular reference called a mirror. Four mirrors are used in HMA: the best swarm member, a randomly selected swarm member, the central point of the space, and the corresponding swarm member. During the confrontative assessment, HMA is confronted with average and subtraction-based optimization (ASBO), total interaction algorithm (TIA), walrus optimization algorithm (WaOA), coati optimization algorithm (COA), and clouded leopard optimization (CLO). The result shows that HMA is superior to ASBO, TIA, WaOA, COA, and CLO in 20, 19, 19, 20, and 20 out of 23 functions, respectively. Moreover, HMA has found the global optimal of eight functions. It means the superiority of HMA occurs in almost entire functions. In the future, the mirroring search can be combined with the guided and neighborhood search to construct a more powerful metaheuristic. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

However, challenges emerge, especially in classification, when dealing with imbalanced datasets. An imbalanced dataset occurs when there is a disproportionate number of samples across different classes. It leads to a machine learning model’s bias towards the majority class and poor recognition of minority classes, often resulting in notable prediction inaccuracies for those less represented classes. This research proposes a cascade and parallel architecture in the training process to enhance accuracy and speed compared to non-cascade and sequential. This research will evaluate the performance of the SVM and Random Forest methods. Our findings reveal that employing the Random Forest method, configured with 100 trees, substantially enhances classification accuracy by 4.72%, elevating it from 58.87% to 63.59% compared to non-cascade classifiers. Furthermore, adopting the Message Passing Interface for Python (MPI4Py) for parallel processing across multiple cores or nodes demonstrates a remarkable increase in training speed. Specifically, parallel processing was found to accelerate the training process by up to 4.35 times, reducing the duration from 1725.86 milliseconds to a mere 396.54 milliseconds. These results highlight the advantages of integrating parallel processing with a cascade architecture in machine learning models, particularly in addressing the challenges associated with imbalanced datasets. This research demonstrates the potential for substantial improvements in classification tasks’ accuracy and efficiency. © 2024 University of Bahrain. All rights reserved."

At one end of the string, a smooth obstacle is placed and the other end of the string is attached to a fixed point. The contact between the string and the obstacle varies in time, and leads to a linear, moving boundary value problem for the string vibrations. By applying a boundary fixing transformation, the problem is transformed from a linear problem with a moving boundary, to a nonlinear problem with fixed boundaries. It is assumed that the vibrations around the stationary position of the string are small. Explicit approximations of the solution are obtained by using a multiple time-scales perturbation method. Depending on the parameters in the problem, it turns out that three different cases for the obstacle boundary condition have to be considered, that is, Dirichlet, or Neumann, or Robin type of boundary conditions. To avoid an infinite-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations that occurs in the analysis of the modal interactions of the string vibrations, characteristic coordinates are used together with a multiple time-scales approach to analyze the string dynamics in terms of traveling waves in opposite directions. A comparison between a direct numerical integration of the PDE problem and the results obtained by using the aforementioned perturbation approach shows an excellent agreement in the results. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The results of FTIR spectra detected amide functional groups (A, B, I, II, III) and imine proline/hydroxyproline, while the results of Raman displayed peak absorption of amide I, amide III, proline/hydroxyproline ring, phenylalanine, and protein backbone. Furthermore, UV–Vis spectra showed typical collagen absorption at 230 nm and based on XRD data, the chain types in the samples were α-helix. ACE1 inhibition activity was obtained in a concentration-dependent manner where the highest was 82.83% and 85.84% at concentrations of 1000, and 2000 µg/mL, respectively, and showed very low cytotoxicity at the concentration less than 1000 µg/mL. In silico study showed an interaction between ACE1 and collagen outside the active site with the affinity of − 213.89 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the active peptides of collagen displayed greater affinity compared to lisinopril, namely HF (His-Phe), WYT (Trp-Tyr-Thr), and WF (Trp-Phe) of − 11.52; − 10.22; − 9.58 kcal/mol, respectively. The salmon skin-derived collagen demonstrated ACE1 inhibition activity with a non-competitive inhibition mechanism. In contrast, the active peptides were predicted as potent competitive inhibitors against ACE1. This study indicated that valorization of fish by-product can lead to the production of a promising bioactive compound to treat COVID-19 patient with diabetic comorbid.

In this study, the application of ITS equipped with Gamification is called ITS + G. Currently, several studies have built the ITS + G. However, there has not been a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that synthesizes the characteristics of the ITS and Gamification combination. Several previous SLRs have been carried out and discussed the ITS only and several other SLRs discussed gamification only. Therefore, this SLR focused on the characteristics of ITS and gamification as a unit. This study succeeded in synthesizing that ITS + G has the potential to be applied to both STEM and non-STEM subjects. Three main game elements are mostly used in ITS + G: levels, points, and progress bars, which are supported for several reasons. Several techniques that have been used to measure the success of ITS + G are synthesized. Several positive impacts of ITS + G are revealed. Some negative impacts that need to be considered and studied in future research are also noticed. The results of this study could be the basis for ITS + G research in the future and increase the repertoire of knowledge related to ITS and Gamification. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023."

Traditional machine learning (ML) methods for anomaly detection often require sharing sensitive IoT data with a central server, posing security and efficiency challenges. In response, this paper introduces FedGroup, a novel Federated Learning (FL) method inspired by FedAvg. FedGroup revolutionizes the central model’s learning process by updating it based on the learning patterns of distinct groups of IoT devices. Our experimental results demonstrate that FedGroup consistently achieves comparable or superior accuracy in anomaly detection when compared to both federated and non-federated learning methods. Additionally, Ensemble Learning (EL) collects intelligence from numerous contributing models, leading to enhanced prediction performance. Furthermore, FedGroup significantly improves the detection of attack types and their details, contributing to a more robust security framework for smart homes. Our approach demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving an accuracy rate of 99.64% with a minimal false positive rate (FPR) of 0.02% in attack type detection, and an impressive 99.89% accuracy in attack type detail detection. © 2023, The Author(s)."

Companies only use intuition when determining when to order products from suppliers and the quantity of products ordered. In addition, there is no product classification in determining which products must be strictly controlled and prioritized. Therefore, this research aims to determine inventory classification and determine the proposed inventory control policy for PT. BWI plywood products, where the product has normal distribution.

This increased environmental consciousness has made it crucial to adopt a sustainable approach to IT equipment procurement that considers factors such as carbon emissions and End-of-Life (EOL) cycle of equipment. Therefore, this research developed a prediction model for IT equipment procurement as the basis of knowledge for an Intelligent Decision Support System based on carbon emissions and EOL phase. The primary aim of this study is to develop a prediction model for IT equipment procurement that allows for the estimation of carbon emissions associated with the equipment. Several models, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Polynomial Regression, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average applied to historical procurement data, and Long Short-Term Memory, were tested to determine the most effective. The developed model has proven successful in predicting IT equipment procurement for future periods, achieving an impressive R-squared score of 0.80.

Using the transfer matrix method, we perform numerical simulations and derive explicit analytical formulas for the optical absorption of the graphene monolayer at the center of the dielectric stack and find that the optical absorption uniquely depends on repetition number (r) and the unit layers structure. When sandwiched between unit layers structure composed of three dielectric materials (referred to as the ‘ABC’ structure) with even values of r, the graphene monolayer absorbs 2.3% of visible to near-infrared light. This behavior is the same as if graphene were free-standing, not sandwiched between the dielectric stack. In contrast to that situation, in the ABC structure with odd values of r, also when the graphene monolayer is sandwiched between four materials (the ‘ABCD’ structure) with any values of r, we can obtain optical absorption as large as 50% at particular refractive indices (n) of the constituent dielectric materials. The 50% absorption is, in fact, the maximum optical absorption for any undoped monolayer material in the symmetric dielectric stacks. By varying r and n within the ABC or ABCD structures, we can finely adjust the optical absorption of graphene within the range of 0%-50%, facilitating precise control for various optoelectronic applications. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd."

However, whilst there were difficulties from the Covid-19 pandemic, it also resulted in a unique opportunity to implement digital transformation of the education system by bringing about positive change. As a consequence educators and students are required to be able to quickly adapt to changes in the online learning system, and educational institutions must invest and update infrastructure by developing online learning platforms that facilitate the teaching and learning process. Using the lens of Lewin's change model, this study aims to explore the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on educational practices, educator perspectives and key determinants of readiness behavior in universities. This study uses a qualitative method by conducting semi-structured in-depth interviews with seventeen key informants who are educators in private universities in Indonesia. This study found that most educators experienced problems during online learning practices, and they realized that these changes in educational practices would continue in the post-Covid era. We also identify two key determinants of behavioural readiness for dealing with change: adaptability and engagement initiative, and innovation in educational practice that helps to understand the digitalization process caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Therefore, separating the signal into multiple sources requires differentiating this TSI into multiple independent TSIs that are intended to represent the individual sources. For instance, when applying the continuous wavelet transform to an electrocardiogram signal that simultaneously encompasses the electrical activities of both the fetal hearts (FECG) and the maternal heart (MECG), a highly intricate energy domain is generated, comprising distinct energy sub-domains. These sub-domains can be effectively separated, extracted, and transformed using a segmentation method, resulting in multiple time-scale images that can be analytically inverted into meaningful electrical signals. The presented method will permit the extraction of the fetal contribution to the FECG with optimal filtering of noise and undesirable electrical interference. Furthermore, the provided algorithms yield unequivocal numerical results, as demonstrated through their application to internationally recognized databases, such as the Daisy database and the Fetal ECG Synthetic database from PhysioNet. The obtained Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Fetal R Peak Detection Accuracy (FRPDA) values serve to illustrate the efficacy of these techniques in isolating FECG signals from unwanted components and noise, thus enhancing the analysis and interpretation of fetal cardiac health. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023."

This research aims to measure the performance of Supply Chain Management at PT Cahaya Amal Taqwa as a new housing developer who focuses on subsidized housing that faces a project delay because they have less data documentation and analysis from previous projects. The issue is most newcomer construction projects never analyze and measure their supply chain management (SCM) which leads them to confusion about the project improvement. The research uses the Supply Chain Operational Reference (SCOR) method to know how much inventory management impacts supply chain management performance and how it overcomes the issues. Most studies only measure the SCM performance and show which aspects need to be developed without any scheme of solution offered. This research presents the scheme of improvement for the inventory model and provides forecasting for the whole SCM performance after the implementation of a new model of inventory management. The findings confirm that inventory management significantly impacts the whole supply chain management performance in the construction industry. The development of a solution system brought comprehensive results by classifying KPIs for inventory management and an interdependence network was created to define the new model of inventory system for the solution. This research proves that improving an aspect will impact significantly the whole SCM performance instead of improving KPIs one by one.  © Iran University of Science and Technology 2024."

FAHP methodology uses triangular fuzzy as a tool for the decision-maker to arrange judgments expressed as the pairwise comparison matrix elements. FAHP is then modeled into a nonlinear constrained optimization problem to increase the decision maker's satisfaction. However, in some cases, this model would yield multiple optimal solutions. Logarithmic fuzzy preference programming (LFPP) is offered to overcome this unfavorable situation. Nevertheless, LFPP includes a parameter in its model for which no specific method is available to determine. Meanwhile, the differences in parameter values will affect the solution. In the worst case, the weights obtained will be inaccurate. As a result, the decision taken based on the weights will be biased and unreliable. This issue is particularly important when it requires high accuracy. It includes the decisions on the portfolio investment, economic, human capital measurements, and shipping registry. Another crucial thing is that the use of the natural logarithm function in the LFPP method has the potential for an overflow effect at the computational stage when it is implemented to derive the weights. Therefore, in the application context, it is significant to improve the shortcomings of the LFPP method in terms of parameter involvement and the use of the logarithmic function. For this purpose, this paper proposes a non-parameter transcendental fuzzy preference programming (TFPP) model for deriving the optimal weights from fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices. The TFPP is obtained by investigating different functions’ effects on fuzzy preference programming (FPP). The proposed method has a more general form. One of the specific forms of the TFPP is chosen in a computational implementation. The numerical results confirm that the TFPP optimization model is reliable in obtaining the optimum global weights. The comparison with the LFPP method also shows that the TFPP is more efficient. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment. However, single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) methods have limited sensitivity and specificity. This study propose an improved ensemble learning approach for arrhythmia detection using multi-lead ECG data. Proposed method, based on a boosting algorithm, namely Fine Tuned Boosting (FTBO) model detects multiple arrhythmia classes. For the feature extraction, introduce a new technique that utilizes a sliding window with a window size of 5 R-peaks. This study compared it with other models, including bagging and stacking, and assessed the impact of parameter tuning. Rigorous experiments on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database focused on Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC), Atrial Premature Contraction (PAC), and Atrial Fibrillation (AF) have been performed. The results showed that the proposed method achieved high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for all three classes of arrhythmia. It accurately detected Atrial Fibrillation (AF) with 100% sensitivity and specificity. For Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC) detection, it achieved 99% sensitivity and specificity in both leads. Similarly, for Atrial Premature Contraction (PAC) detection, proposed method achieved almost 96% sensitivity and specificity in both leads. The proposed method shows great potential for early arrhythmia detection using multi-lead ECG data. © 2024 Mandala et al.

Process mining techniques can discover process models that reflect the actual behaviour of the process implementations by using event logs extracted from information systems. However, the process models discovered by process mining often have too many variations and deviations when compared to the actual SOPs of the processes. This study attempted to compare three prediction methods in finding a process model from process mining that has the closest properties to the actual SOP. The compared methods are Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC), the four quality dimensions, and similarity measures for structural and behavioural similarities. For the experiment, we designed a synthetic SOP that served as a ground truth for evaluating the performance of the three prediction methods in this study. We used a synthetic event log extracted from a dummy information system we particularly built for this study to test the methods. This study’s results can be useful, e.g. for auditors to save a lot of time from conducting extensive surveys when SOPs are not readily available. (Received in May 2023, accepted in November 2023.

Decentralized networks offer equality, accessibility, and security at a societal level, while blockchain technology guarantees security, authentication, and openness. Integrating blockchain technology with decentralized characteristics has become increasingly significant in finance; we call this “decentralized finance” (DeFi). As of January 2023, the DeFi crypto market capitalized USD 46.21 billion and served over 6.6 million users. As DeFi continues to outperform traditional finance (TradFi), it provides reduced fees, increased inclusivity, faster transactions, enhanced security, and improved accessibility, transparency, and programmability; it also eliminates intermediaries. For end users, DeFi presents asset custody options, peer-to-peer transactions, programmable control features, and innovative financial solutions. Despite its rapid growth in recent years, there is limited comprehensive research on mapping DeFi’s benefits and risks alongside its role as an enabling technology within the financial services sector. This research addresses these gaps by developing a DeFi classification system, organizing information, and clarifying connections among its various aspects. The research goal is to improve the understanding of DeFi in both academic and industrial circles to promote comprehension of DeFi taxonomy. This well-organized DeFi taxonomy aids experts, regulators, and decision-makers in making informed and strategic decisions, thereby fostering responsible integration into TradFi for effective risk management. This study enhances DeFi security by providing users with clear guidance on existing mechanisms and risks in DeFi, reducing susceptibility to misinformation, and promoting secure participation. Additionally, it offers an overview of DeFi’s role in shaping the future of the internet. © 2024 by the authors."

However, the influence zone is unable to answer the dynamic value of k efficiently as it needs to know this value in advance. In this paper, a concept is introduced whereby the influence zone is expanded to enable answering the dynamic value of k as well. Furthermore, a concept is proposed that expands the influence zone of k= 1. Experimental results indicate that the expanded influence zone is able to answer RkNN queries even when the k value is dynamic, without the need to recompute it. Furthermore, the experiments show that the use of pre-computed regions will provide a stable query time for any value of k. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

The helical twisted tape design enhances turbulence, improving nanofluid mixing and thermal exchange. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) validates the efficiency of the parabolic trough solar water heater (PTSWH) with emphasis on solar light concentration and feed water flow velocity. Optimal conditions include a 0.3% ZnO nanofluid volume concentration, mass flow rates between 1.0 kg/min and 5.0 kg/min, and copper-type twisted helical tapes. Experimental results reveal Nusselt number enhancements of 15.1% and 20.96% at H/D = 10, and 16.72% and 32.12% at H/D = 3, for 0.3% ZnO nanofluid, at Reynolds numbers from 3000 to 8000. The twisted tape arrangement at H/D = 3 exhibits increased fluid mixing, leading to higher convective heat transfer. Friction factor enhancements at Reynolds numbers 3000 and 8000 are 0.26% and 0.38%, respectively, compared to the base fluid. At a 3.0 kg/min mass flow rate, thermal efficiency increases to 39.25%, a 13.25% gain over plain tapes.

However, reanalysis data is often deviate from the real value measured on site. In this paper, reanalysis weather data from ECWMF is evaluated using respective ground measured data using bias measurement parameter.

Characterizing the diurnal variations and the influence of meteorology is critical for understanding the drivers of air pollution and planning effective mitigation strategies. We studied the diurnal variation of PM2.5 and its relationship with meteorological variables in seven cities representing Indonesia’s three different rainfall patterns during 2021. We used half-hourly PM2.5 concentrations obtained by air quality monitoring system (AQMS), planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) estimation from radiosonde, and meteorological parameters from meteorological stations. A bimodal pattern with two peaks appears in Padang, Manado, Palu, and Pangkalpinang, while in Jakarta, Surabaya, and Pontianak, the diurnals have a unimodal pattern with one peak at night until morning. All cities generally present higher diurnal PM2.5 concentrations in the dry season than in the wet season. The relationship between PM2.5 concentration and PBLH shows Jakarta, Surabaya, Padang, and Pontianak have a strong anti-correlation for different seasons, while the unusual positive correlation occurs in Padang. The Pearson correlation between PM2.5 concentration with each meteorological factor is significant in monthly data and insignificant in daily data. Implementation of Multiple Wavelet Coherence (MWC) with various meteorological variables reveals that the combination of four parameters provides a stronger influence on the PM2.5 concentration in all the observed locations. Wavelet analysis also observes distinct scale periods that represent higher haze concentrations in Jakarta and Surabaya from May to September. Meanwhile, the investigation on the extreme rise of PM2.5 in Pontianak due to peatland forest fires using HYSPLIT shows that emission from the surrounding area significantly raises the maximum half-hourly in Pontianak to 700 µg m–3. © 2024, AAGR Aerosol and Air Quality Research.

Design/methodology/approach: The study population was all members of “Sharia Property Developer” (DPS) across Indonesia with criteria of having subordinates at least one person and is listed as a DPS member. The samples used were 71 people from the 200 members of DPS across Indonesia. The sampling method used was based on R2 value and significance level with an 80% statistical strength. Data analysis was carried out using smartPLS software to test the relationship of change management, job satisfaction, organizational commitment and leadership style on employee performance. Findings: The utilization of SEM in Smart PLS for change management with the ADKAR method had a negative value of 6.2% in affecting employee performance and 4.6% in affecting job satisfaction. Job satisfaction insignificantly affected employee performance by 7.5%. Leadership style and organizational commitment positively affected performance by 57.9% and 25.6%, respectively. Research limitations/implications: This study did not limit respondents’ education levels. Twenty percent of respondents were middle and high school graduates. Respondent’s position was mostly the highest leader in the company by 58%. Indicators in the ADKAR model did not implement the construct validity test since the researchers did not find precedent studies that discuss the indicators of the ADKAR model in detail. Practical implications: Factors that positively and significantly affected employee performance can be used to plan employee performance of DPS member companies. Social implications: The company must create a program to produce meaning in working, shape leaders to have discipline by putting appropriate employees as leaders. Originality/value: This study used change management, organizational commitment, job satisfaction and leadership style as exogenous variables, job satisfaction and leadership style as intervening variables. The study model modified the previous study regarding employee performance improvement because it utilized the change management with the ADKAR model.

This was achieved by using manganese sulfate as the source of manganese as well as triethylenetetramine (TETA) and extracts from pineapple leaf (ananas comosus), hibiscus rosa leaf, and ginger root (zingiber Officinale) to prepare the ink. During the experimentation, it was discovered that the application of different plant extract solutions led to the production of several manganese oxides. Moreover, electrode fabricated from Mn-TETA-GE had different forms of MnO, Mn2O3, and Mn3O4 as well as the highest average specific capacitance of 38 F g−1 which was almost a steady value. The results also showed that the presence of gingerol in the ginger extract solution led to the reduction of manganese ion to Mn. Furthermore, the oxidation state of Mn was varied to Mn2+ and Mn3+ due to the acidic condition of gingerol content. The variation of manganese oxide was not found to be significant in film electrode fabricated using hibiscus rosa and pineapple extracts.

The governing equations and numerical schemes are written in terms of normalized variables, with two dimensionless parameters representing dispersion and non-linearity. By utilizing analytical solutions and laboratory experiments, this study aims to validate the numerical NH-2LR model and investigate the effects of dispersion and non-linearity on the resulting waves. The first validation employs the analytical solution of the linear and fully dispersive model of a landslide moving with constant velocity on a flat bottom. The second validation involves a landslide hump sliding over a constant beach slope. A closer look at the run-up height reveals that this case is non-dispersive. Furthermore, we found that the dispersion effect was evident from the beginning of the wave formation process. Finally, we compare our numerical results to experiments on submarine landslides on sloping beaches. We found that dispersion is essential in the early generation and propagation of waves in off-shore regions.

Knowledge management has been widely used in various businesses, governments, and other institutions. Finding, capturing, sharing, and utilizing various types of knowledge are all part of the knowledge management process, which aims to increase organizational performance. Theoretical Literature Review is used in this study to fully understand the theories already in existence, their relationships, and the degree to which they have been studied. The creation of research questions is the initial step in performing this study. After that, search for various genres of literature that were released in research journals between 2017 and 2021. SpringerLink, Excellence Research Australia (ERA), Science Direct, IEEE, and THESAI are some of the journal databases included in this study. The purpose of this research is to get a deeper understanding of the knowledge management framework, identify its weaknesses and strengths, as well as commonly used knowledge management methods and processes, as a guideline for future research to develop a more effective knowledge management framework. Observations of the knowledge management process within the knowledge management framework revealed that multiple knowledge creation, knowledge sharing, information repository, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge application procedures are frequently utilized. Regarding knowledge transformation and knowledge brokers, their use is currently infrequent. In addition, the knowledge management framework's strengths include enhanced swifter decision-making, enhanced competitive advantage, increased cooperation & partnership management, increased constant innovation, the best organizational traits, increased worker productivity, and integrated management. Nonetheless, the management framework has several flaws, such as a data collection process with numerous questions that can lead to confusion in determining the issue's focus, the absence of an evaluation process, the absence of framework testing, and the framework's limited implementation that can only be used in domains. In the future, a better suitable framework can be created using the comparison of knowledge management frameworks. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved."

Data were collected from the financial and annual reports of 165 Islamic rural banks across the nation, with a focused sample of 30 banks in the West Java region, spanning the years 2016 to 2021. The analysis, conducted through EViews version 10, employed multiple linear regression analysis on panel data to ascertain the relationships in question. It was found that non-performing financing (NPF) exerts a significant adverse effect on the sustainability of these banks' operations, whereas a positive influence is observed in the case of the capital adequacy ratio (CAR). Furthermore, digital transformation was identified as a critical moderating factor, enhancing the negative impact of NPF and bolstering the positive impact of CAR on business sustainability. The findings suggest that Islamic rural banks in Indonesia embarking on digital transformation initiatives must prioritize information transparency, financial stability, and the cultivation of innovative capabilities. Additionally, the selection of digital transformation strategies should be tailored to the banks' unique characteristics, including property rights, operational scale, and growth potential. This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence of the significant role digital transformation plays in influencing the relationship between financial health indicators and sustainability in the context of Islamic rural banking.  © 2024 The authors."

The voltage balancing system requires monitoring in the use of rechargeable batteries so that they can be utilized properly and can improve the electrical energy storage system. In this research, a monitored lead acid battery voltage balancing system was designed so that the management of the battery voltage balance level and the storage of electrical energy in rechargeable batteries can be stored and used optimally. In this research a series of lead acid battery voltage detection and power dissipation circuits were designed. The power dissipation circuit uses the controlled shunt resistor method which is used when the voltage of the lead acid battery being charged exceeds the maximum voltage. This method is easy to implement and can display the value of the lead acid battery voltage and other parameters, so that it can be monitored by the user. The results obtained show that the average voltage error for batteries 1 and 2 is 0.09% and 0.3% respectively. The power dissipation circuit can dissipate lead acid battery power above the reference voltage VREF=±7 V, with a balanced voltage of 6.8 V at 140 minutes and 160 minutes. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

In FMS, mobile robots are commonly deployed in material handling system for the purpose of increasing the efficiency and productivity of the manufacturing process. A reliable, efficient, and optimal scheduling is the most important in manufacturing system. The scheduling problems can become highly complex, especially in large-scale systems with numerous tasks and constraints. Thus, schedule optimization becomes crucial to enhance target performance by determining the best allocations and sequences of resources under specified constraints. Recently, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a remarkably applicable search algorithm to solve scheduling problems to the way that near optimal could be found. While the performance of GA much depends on the selection of the main parameters, a standard GA may suffer from the issue of premature convergence due to the lack of control on its parameters especially crossover and mutation operators. As there is no specific method or way to tune these parameters, the algorithm is prone to converge on the local optimum, thereby leading to performance degradation. To overcome such flaw, this paper proposed an improved Genetic Algorithm using an adaptive Fuzzy Logic to control crossover and mutation operators (FGAOC) for the solution to the NP-hard problem of scheduling mobile robot within Job-Shop FMS environment. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated in several case studies such as small and large-scale problem, various numbers of mobile robots and the 40-test benchmark problem. The results have demonstrated that the proposed FGAOC has delivered a good performance in exploration-exploitation activities with better solution quality. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

It consists of three phases. There are two searches that are opposite to each other performed in each phase. In the first phase, the search toward and away from the best solution is carried out. In the second phase, the search toward and away from the middle between two randomly picked solutions is carried out. In the third phase, a neighborhood search around the narrow and large space is carried out. A candidate is selected among the two searches in every phase. TOA is challenged to solve theoretical and practical problems. The 23 functions represent theoretical problems, while the portfolio optimization of stocks in the banking sector listed in IDX30 represents the practical problem. TOA is compared with five metaheuristics: grey wolf optimization (GWO), golden search optimization (GSO), average subtraction-based optimization (ASBO), zebra optimization algorithm (ZOA), and coati optimization algorithm (COA). The result indicates that TOA is superior to its competitors as it is better than GWO, GSO, ZOA, ASBO, and COA in 22, 23, 19, 20, and 19 functions respectively, in handling 23 functions and produces the highest total capital gain in handling portfolio optimization problem. In the future, TOA can be utilized to handle many other real-world optimization problems. Moreover, TOA can be hybridized with other metaheuristics to improve its performance. © 2024 The authors.

There are two types of electrolysis equipment, namely batch type and continuous type, that can produce it. Continuous type tools are fast but expensive. Batch type tools are cheaper, but the process is slow. Both types of equipment require large amounts of energy and are expensive to operate. Another problem is that the content of the ions that form alkaline and acidic water is not yet known. Objective:The Objective is to determine the changes in ions that occur on the anode and cathode sides, to investigate the types of ions that most influence the formation of alkaline and acidic water, and to create a piper diagram. The aim of this research is to create a device that can produce alkaline and acidic water at a price that is affordable for the wider community. Method: This equipment is made from a portable plastic teapot as the cathode side and a small bottle as the anode side. The anode and cathode sides are separated by a cellulose cotton membrane, with carbon and stainless steel (SS) electrodes. The electric voltage taken from a solar cell module is 12 V;50 Wp. The output voltage of electrolysis was converted to 45 VDC in one hour. Electrolyzed water with an initial pH of 6.71 was taken from the Regional Drinking Water Company (PDAM) of Bandung City, Indonesia. Testing for the content of ions in water using American Public Health Association (APHA) standards was carried out in the laboratory of the ITB-Bandung Environmental Engineering department. Results and Conclusions: Based on the test on the sample, it was determined that the formation of alkaline water at the cathode side with pH 8.32 is caused by the ions Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, and K+, with a concentration of 0.387; 0.369; 0.302; and 0.284 mmol/L, respectively. Some of the Mg2+ ions were precipitated. The formation of acidic water at the anode side with pH 2.34 was caused by the anions Cl-, NO3- , SO42-, and CO32-/HCO3 with a concentration of 1,757; 0.052; 0.147, and 3.153 mmol/L, respectively. Furthermore, it is concluded that the electrolysis device is designed for the production of alkaline and acid water at a capacity of 1400 mL in 60 minutes, with an average energy of 0.002 kWh and a cost of unit production of around Rp. 2.8. Research Implications: Useful for the development of education, teaching, and further research, especially in electrochemical major, as well as community service in making alkaline and acidic water for health.

Generally, tourists want to visit a new destination for several days. To get route guidance (visiting schedule), tourists usually use the services of a travel agent, but this service cannot be tailored to the tourist’s wishes. In previous research, many have concluded that one-day and multi-day tourist routes are analogous to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). However, this study has yet to emphasize daily optimization for multi-day routes because daily routes are only cut based on time constraints. One possible approach to optimize tourist routes per day is the analogy of solving Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). Therefore, in this research, we propose a new model that combines the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) with a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) strategy known as WOA-VNS to recommend multi-day tourist routes, which is analogous to the VRP to overcome deficiencies with the TSP analogy. The number of vehicles corresponds to the number of days tourists visit, thus ensuring optimal daily routes. The system considers user preferences for popularity, ratings, and time using the concept of Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT). The MAUT value are used as WOA-VNS fitness values. Five metrics (fitness value, number of Point of Interest (POI)s, trip duration, cost, and rating attributes) were tested on five random POIs.

This NP-completeness implies that the Juosan puzzle is polynomial-time reducible to the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem, thereby allowing us to transform the puzzle into SAT problems. This paper introduces an efficient SAT-based approach for solving the Juosan puzzles. We first discuss the rules and derived properties of Juosan puzzles and translate them into Boolean formulas in Conjunctive Normal Forms (CNF). We show that the number of clauses and propositional variables used in the encoding is polynomially proportional to the puzzle’s size. Using this encoding, we successfully implement a declarative program with no search algorithm using MiniSAT in C++ to solve any Juosan puzzle with up to 1350 cells in less than one second on a standard personal computer. Experimental results show that our SAT-based approach outperforms the optimized backtracking algorithm for larger puzzles. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

Four depictions of buildings, interpreted as houses, appear in the third band of Makalamau’s tympan. They constitute as one of the earliest depictions of architectural edifice and interior space found in Indonesia. Despite the Makalamau kettledrum’s Vietnamese provenance, the house images therein are representative of Austronesian style architecture that were used in ancient Vietnam and Indonesia. The Makalamau house images itself have distinctive articulation which are not found in house images of other kettledrums. These include the tripartite vertical division of the house, multi-purpose open space rooms, lack of loose furniture but the use of built-in fixtures such as suspended para racks, and a sacred aspect as repository of heirlooms. These elements can still be linked with traditional features in vernacular Indonesian houses from various regions. This shows that some aspects of traditional Indonesian interior can be ascribed as resilient continuation of Austronesian elements used since at least the 3rd century CE and this can be the subject of further studies and appreciation to the region’s architectural history and cultural heritage. © 2024 SEAMEO SPAFA and author."

Universities are flooded with ever-increasing data, but the information tends to be poor. Some universities implement data governance programs (DGPs) by first assessing the level of data governance maturity. From these results, it was concluded that the gap was a problem. The gaps that occur in several frameworks are related to processes, technology, and people. In principle, when improving data governance, the process and technology parts can be improved relatively easily because there are clear indicators that need attention. The problem that still occurs is related to the involvement of users or people or actors in the data governance process. The university also needs a mechanism that can resolve problems in implementing data governance. The reason is the concept of data culture. This paper proposes a measurement mechanism to determine which aspects of data culture will influence the implementation of data governance. The research was conducted using the multiple linear regression (MLR) method to look at the domain of data culture aspects that influence the implementation of the DGP. The research results show that of the three research variables, namely domain importance, planning and context (IPC), domain perception, usability and communication (PUC), and domain people, leadership, and relationship (PLR), the PLR variable is the variable that has the greatest influence on DGP compared to the other two variables.

Many studies that handled ED problem employed metaheuristics as the optimization technique. Unfortunately, these metaheuristics are old or the existing ones. Meanwhile, ED problem is not the favourite constrained case in studies that introduced a novel metaheuristic. This research introduces a novel metaheuristic called quadratic time optimization (QTO). QTO comprises three sequential searches where both diversification and intensification are blended in every search. But the portion of both orientations changes by following the quadratic time. The appraisal of QTO is performed by employing it to solve both unconstrained and constrained problems. The 23 traditional functions represent the unconstrained problem while economic load dispatch (ELD) problem with valve point effect and spinning reserve problem represents the constrained problem. In both appraisals, there are five novel metaheuristics represent the benchmarks, including: walrus optimization algorithm (WaOA), coati optimization algorithm (COA), total interaction algorithm (TIA), addax optimization algorithm (AOA), and language education optimization (LEO). The result shows the competitiveness of the proposed QTO in handling both unconstrained and constrained problems. QTO becomes the first best in 8 functions out of 23 functions including five high dimension unimodal functions, two high dimension multimodal functions, and one fixed dimension multimodal functions. The result also shows that QTO is competitive in three use cases in ELD problems as the ratio between the range and average total cost among metaheuristics for the first, second, and third cases is 0.72, 0.04, and 0.02 percent consecutively. © (2024), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

Recent works in a similar field mainly focus on developing IDS systems via centralized learning approaches of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which require participants to forward their information. Another solution that has been introduced is utilizing FL with a centralized server, which successfully preserves participant privacy and reduces communication overhead. However, the threat of adopting centralized FL still remains. To mitigate the single point of failure, decentralized FL can be considered. We propose a mechanism that controls the aggregation flow in decentralized FL by introducing a loss-based approach in an independent and identically distributed (IID) environment. This method allows the system to train the model based on participants’ losses. By utilizing this, the performance of the decentralized FL system can be improved as the bias from the learning process is reduced. The results show that the proposed loss-based decentralized FL is capable of preserving participant privacy while also improving the overall model performance with an F1-score of 80.04% under the CICIoT2023 dataset. It is worth noting that compared with traditional decentralized FL, the proposed system is able to deliver better performance, up to 7.83%. ©2024 IEEE."

Now we have entered Beyond Fifth Generation (B5G) where all technology will be built in a network, such as smart buildings, smart devices and other IoT that use the Internet. The use of 5G technology has led to new needs or new concepts such as small antennas that can work at high frequencies. However, in its application there are still areas that have not been covered by 5G technology. Therefore, 5G technology is needed that can reach areas that use a lot of data that has a simple, small and compact design. In this paper, a method of increasing the gain of a microstrip antenna using a metasurface is presented. The proposed antenna is an antenna with a metasurface layer that has a 3 × 3 unit cell. The design of the metasurface is very simple using a single split ring (SSR). The proposed antenna is designed to operate at a frequency of 3.5GHz. This antenna design presents a parametric study of several metasurface structures and designs. This paper also describes the effect of current distribution on antenna performance, where the current flows in the vertical SSR patch element so that the magnetic induction has a direction that produces a magnetic field opposite to the magnetic field flux. If lring is constant and the distance between elements and the size of the unit cell are adjusted, we will be able to control the capacitance value. And if lring is constant while the distance between elements and the width of the slot are adjusted then wring will be the main parameter to control inductance. The addition of slots to the SSR will provide flexibility in adjusting the properties of the resonator. The antenna has been designed and successfully increased the gain of the microstrip antenna. The paper also describes the effect of current distribution on antenna performance. The antenna has a bandwidth of 220.4MHz and also has a radiation pattern of 61.9° for azimuth and an elevation radiation pattern of 81.3°.

This can be attributed to its compact dimensions (17 cm x 13 cm x 37 cm) and relatively lightweight (1.5 kg when dry and 2.5 kg when filled with water). Another advantage of this device is its ability to operate without a connection to household electricity, making it a practical and easily transportable option for users on the move. The positive results from the portability testing affirm that the portable water ionizer device successfully meets desired portability standards. With its convenient design for transportability, this device can serve as an efficient and convenient solution for individuals who frequently travel and prioritize the quality of the water they consume. ©2024 IEEE."

Tuberculosis (TB) stands out as one of the most prevalent opportunistic infections and the primary cause of mortality among individuals with HIV. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 390,000 deaths globally due to HIV/TB co-infection. Timely detection of HIV/TB co-infection enables prompt administration of Anti-Tuberculosis Drugs (OAT) and antiretroviral drugs (ARV) to patients. Presently, TB detection in HIV patients relies on smear culture examination, involving sputum sampling. An alternative approach to TB detection in HIV patients involves microarray technology. Microarray technology allows for the simultaneous analysis of gene expression patterns across thousands of genes in a particular bodily area. Given the large dimensions of microarray data, a machine learning technique is indispensable for facilitating analysis. This study employs dimension reduction and classification processes within the framework of machine learning to develop an accurate microarray data classification model. The aim is to evaluate the performance of a TB detection model for HIV patients, employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. The optimal model, utilizing the RBF kernel with seven features, yielded accuracy and F1 score values of 0.86 and 0.83, respectively. © 2024 IEEE."

The nutrition in milk is fundamental for children’s growth which is why the parents will ensure their children have adequate milk intake from an early age. Various kinds of milk are available on the market, but pasteurized milk and UHT milk are the most consumed. Without proper storage and packaging conditions, milk could spoil quickly; hence an early detection method is needed to detect milk staleness and spoilage. Much research and study has been done regarding the classification of milk spoilage. However, factors such as the unreliability of data and time-consuming methods prove that a better working model with high accuracy needs to be developed. Efficient detection methods are crucial for ensuring milk quality. This proposed paper is targeted to develop and introduce image based analysis to detect the spoiled milk in various packaging and storage conditions using Deep Learning and Python programming language to cater for the problem stated above. A dataset containing both RGB and thermal images of milk was self-obtained. Both datasets undergo image processing method to enlarge the datasets. They were then divided into training dataset, validation dataset and testing dataset. The proposed model developed in this proposed paper is based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which were modified to produce a high percentage accuracy result.

Still, it suffers from unpredictable channel transmission, especially in the Rician channel. To overcome the issue in transmission, we used one channel coding strategy, namely the quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC). This study aims to evaluate the performance of power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA), which allows multiple users to share the same spectrum in a downlink communication system from HAPS to three ground stations. We simulated the system using MATLAB simulation with different power allocation coefficients for every ground station. The simulation results showed that QC-LDPC codes can significantly lower the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required to achieve the same bit error rate (BER) as uncoded NOMA, especially in scenarios with uneven power allocation. The average improvement of QC-LDPC over uncoded NOMA was 8.4% in SNR. However, we also observed that NOMA is prone to domino errors, where decoding errors in one ground station can propagate and degrade the performance of the subsequent ground station. Furthermore, we found that power allocation significantly impacts the system performance, while the location and power allocation of the second ground station have a minor effect. Based on these findings, we conclude that QC-LDPC can enhance system performance in scenarios with low received power and that power allocation is a crucial factor for NOMA systems with multiple ground stations.

Increasing these two factors is believed to be able to reduce the percentage of NEET in every province in Indonesia. To find out the relationship between these two factors and how much influence they have on the percentage of NEET, this research is modeled by Cauchy regression and includes spatial effects. The results of the analysis show that the best model is when the spatial effect is modeled by Fernandez Steel Skew Normal conditionally autoregressive (FSSN CAR). This result is seen from the smallest value of the Watanabe Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC) in this model, which is 190.5.

Due to this shortage, the government had to import rice to meet the needs of the people, at the same time affecting the national economy. The shortage of rice can be caused by many factors and one of them is because of the decrease in rice production productivity due to the failure to prevent diseases that affect crop yields earlier. If no control measures are implemented after the infection begins, the disease may cause rice yield losses of up to half of the production. Hence, early detection of these diseases is important for effective management and control strategies. This study aims to develop a model that is able to detect paddy plant disease by using Google Teachable Machine. This model is compared to the model developed using You Only Look Once (YOLO) version 8. As the primary dataset has not been collected yet, this study utilized dataset from the Internet.

Existing methodologies, particularly those reliant on a single biomarker derived from CiPA O'Hara-Rudy (CiPAORdv1.0) ventricular cell model without the hERG dynamic as input to the individual machine learning model, have limitations in capturing the complexity inherent in the comprehensive range of factors influencing drug-induced TdP risk. This study aims to overcome these limitations by proposing a stacking ensemble machine learning approach by integrating multiple in silico biomarkers derived from the CiPAORdv1.0 with hERG dynamic characteristics. The ensemble machine learning model consisted of three artificial neural network (ANN) models as baseline model and support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models as meta-classifier. The highest AUC score of 1.00 (0.90–1.00) for high risk, 0.97 (0.84–1.00) for intermediate risk, and 1.00 (0.87–1.00) for low risk were obtained using seven biomarkers derived from the CiPAORdv1.0 with hERG dynamic characteristics. Furthering our investigation, we explored the model's robustness by incorporating interindividual variability into the generation of in silico biomarkers from a population of human ventricular cell models. This study also enabled an analysis of TdP risk classification under high clinical exposure and therapeutic scenarios for several drugs. Additionally, from a sensitivity analysis, we revealed four important ion channels, namely, CaL, NaL, Na, and Kr channels that affect significantly the important biomarkers for TdP risk prediction. © 2024 The Author(s).

Therefore, this study was conducted by developing and integrating a research framework with an expectation confirmation (ECO) model to assess the magnitude of user satisfaction (SAT) and acceptance of digital banking services that incorporate artificial intelligence. A total of 307 responses were obtained using questionnaires and then analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The findings show that all aspects affect user satisfaction with digital banking, except customization. Similarly, user acceptance of AI-based digital banking is influenced by customer satisfaction and corporate reputation (CRP). Based on the findings of the impact calculations on SEM and IPMA (importance performance analysis), corporate reputation has more influence on the acceptance of AI digital banking than user satisfaction.

Using the SIR model and the fourth order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method allows for examining infection spread dynamics in Bekasi City during the specified time frame. The obtained values for the infection rate and recovery rate are 1.163 and 0.912, respectively. These values result in a relative error value captured by dividing the root mean square error (RMSE) by the maximum value of the actual data, yielding 8.57%. This percentage indicates a satisfactory level of conformity between the model and the actual data, suggesting that the model demonstrates a relatively good fit to the observed data.  © 2024 IEEE."

The functionality of SRM as beam control in the X-band frequency range is demonstrated through simulation and experimentation. The operational states of SRM can be changed by toggling its unit cell between ON and OFF, indicating connected and unconnected line resonators, respectively. The fundamental concept behind the unit cell involves dividing an extended line into shorter ones to alter the resonant frequency, thereby causing a shift in the phase between states. Here, the developed reflective metasurfaces are promising in multi-bit SRM design. Through out infinite array of unit cell, it is demonstrated that the phase shift between two states achieves 180 degrees at the frequency of 9.35GHz for 1-bit SRM. While for 2-bit SRM, the phase shift between consecutive states is around 90 degrees at the frequency of 10.16GHz.

Currently, the weed removal process is still done manually by farmers. This manual method makes farmers tired if the cultivation area is large.

Therefore, we need a precise weed detection system to correctly classify weed and corn seedlings. The challenge in this research is that the plants in the dataset used are still small, even almost the same size. In this research, the classification method proposed is transfer learning and machine learning. First, MobileNetV2 is used in the feature extraction stage.

This research also tested the accuracy of results with or without segmentation. The experimental results show that hybrid MobileNetV2-SVM without segmentation can achieve 0.985 accuracy.

First, there are not any metaheuristic is able to solve all problems superiorly. Second, the cross-dimension mapping between the entity and its reference during performing the directed search is rare to find. Based on these problems, this work introduces a new metaphor-free swarm-based metaheuristic called the triple-shake algorithm (TSA). As its name suggests, TSA consists of three directed searches. The reference in the first search is the balance mixture between the finest entity and the member of permutation set. The reference in the second search is the balance mixture between the finest entity and a randomly chosen entity. The reference in the third search is the finest entity only. But the cross-dimension mapping is performed in this third search with 50 percent probability. In the benchmark assessment, TSA is compared with zebra optimization algorithm (ZOA), walrus optimization algorithm (WaOA), migration algorithm (MA), total interaction algorithm (TIA), and one-to-one based optimization (OOBO).

The parameters examined encompass the risk management committee (RMC), public ownership, institutional ownership, and managerial ownership of the ISO 31000:2018 standard RMD. This study utilized quantitative methods, collecting a total of 133 observations from 2013 to 2022. The regression results for the panel data show that CG has an impact on RMD. Although RMC greatly improves RMD, the positive ownership structure does not have a substantial effect. Increasing the proportion of RMC in the composition results in improved legibility of RMDs.

Finally, we benchmarked the NearCount-PoS method with the shuffle-split edited nearest neighbor (SSENN) method. The test results show that, on the MMSD with 900 samples, NearCount with K=6 provides 31% samples without reducing the accuracy of KNN in making predictions. The NearCount-PoS test results on the smart lighting dataset show that NearCount with K=159 provides samples of 42% with a KNN prediction accuracy reduced by 0.0001 from the accuracy of KNN predictions on the original sample with a value of 0.9998. Benchmarks with SSENN show that NearCount-PoS provides higher KNN prediction accuracy at sample numbers above 9,000. © 2024 IEEE."

Experimental measurements are conducted by capturing the received power when the receiving antenna is rotated from 0 to 90 degrees by 10 degrees interval. There are three scenarios proposed for the measurement: (1) linear or circular polarization for transmitting and receiving antennas; (2) circular polarization for transmitting antenna, and linear polarization for receiving antenna; (3) linear polarization for transmitting antenna, and circular polarization for receiving antenna. Two sets of circularly polarized triangular antenna array and linearly polarized triangular antenna array are used for the measurements taken in an anechoic chamber with the distance between antennas fulfilling far-field specifications. Based on the measurement results, polarization mismatch between the incoming wave and the receiving antenna causes the decrease in received power level. The results also show that the polarization efficiency mostly depends on the shape and polarization capability of antenna.  © 2024 IEEE."

A short segment between R to R of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals was chosen to generate single heartbeat samples by enforcing a rigid length thresholding procedure combined with an interpolation technique. Additionally, we explored the benefits of the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to tackle the imbalance in sample distribution among individuals. The proposed framework was evaluated individually and in a mixture of four public databases: MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSRDB), MIT-BIH Arrhythmia (MIT-ARR), ECG-ID, and MIMIC-III which are available in the Physionet repository. The proposed framework demonstrated excellent performance, achieving a perfect score (100%) across all metrics (i.e., accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1-score) on individual NSRDB and MIT-ARR databases. Meanwhile, the performance remained high, reaching more than 99.6% on mixed datasets that contain larger populations and more diverse conditions. The impressive performance demonstrated in both small and large subject groups emphasizes the model’s scalability and potential for widespread implementation, particularly in security contexts where timely authentication is crucial.

Therefore, this study aims to measure acid rain in real-time by measuring parameters such as pH, temperature, conductivity, and precipitation to test the acidity contained in rainwater and evaluate the tool's performance with data for March 2022. The analysis uses various statistical methods: anomaly detection, outlier detection, central tendency, person correlation analysis, Mean Absolute Percentage Error, T-test, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Each parameter can be worked out in real-time based on the central tendency and rain dispersion results. If there is only daily rain, then the correlation for each parameter is the highest, namely pH if there is acid rain. The real-time average pH is 6.45; in the laboratory, it is 6.56, so the MAPE value is 5.37 (good category). Even though this tool can work well, it needs to improve the quality of the temperature control in it. Since temperature significantly affects pH, the results show a negative correlation of -0.80 between pH and temperature.

Today, consumer awareness of sustainable consumption behaviours has risen, pathing the way for a slow fashion movement that practices socially conscious and environmentally responsible clothing manufacturing processes. By tradition, Batik production pursues slow fashion practices. However, the current production processes of modern Batik are being criticised for using fast fashion manufacturing techniques, which are environmentally damaging. Hence, it is crucial for consumers to differentiate and purchase environmentally friendly Batik apparel. Extending the Theory of Planned Behaviour, new variables (environmental knowledge and eco-labelling) are added to the original constructs (attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control) to propose an enhanced consumer purchase intention model for slow fashion (Batik) apparel amongst Malaysian consumers. This study adopts mixed methods research that combines both qualitative and quantitative approaches to answer the research question. The expected outcomes of the study are twofold: socio-environmental protection and cultural heritage preservation through sustainable consumption behaviour of eco-friendly Batik apparel. The study supports the 10-10 MySTIE and Key Economic Growth Activities 15 in Shared Prosperity Vision 2030 in promoting Batik as a form of heritage and experience-based tourism that can revitalise the local Batik industry as one of the socio-economic drivers.

Most of these techniques were tested to solve the sets of theoretical functions. Some of them were enriched with practical tests where the common use cases are the mechanical engineering designs. On the other hand, the similar studies that utilized the optimization in power system are difficult to find. Moreover, the environmental issues become major considerations in engineering field. Based on this evidence, this paper constructs a new swarm-based optimization technique called stay-jump optimizer (SJO). The equal size swarm split is applied in the beginning of the process. Then, two directed searches toward the highest quality sub-swam members and two randomly selected higher quality sub swarm members are employed. The performance investigation is performed by employing SJO to find the optimal solution of 23 classic functions and the economic emission dispatch (EED) problem. The use-case for EED is the Java-Bali power grid system in Indonesia that consists of six steam power plants and two hydro-electric power plants. Five new optimization techniques including addax optimization algorithm (AOA), dollmaker optimization algorithm (DOA), giant armadillo optimization algorithm (GAO), zebra optimization algorithm (ZOA), and total interaction algorithm (TIA). The result shows that SJO is superior to its opponents as it is better than AOA, DOA, GAO, ZOA, and TIA in 17, 17, 16, 19, and 14 functions out of 23 functions respectively. SJO also becomes the best in the EED problem. © (2024), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society). All rights reserved."

However, reading too many reviews causes information overload, making users even more confused. The skincare recommender system that has been built has not been able to resolve the sparsity of explicit ratings and information overloading of reviews. Therefore, we introduced a skincare recommender system using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Recommender System (BERT-RS) that combines Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) and BERT. This approach can improve the NCF model by adding the ability to analyze potential and emotional factors in textual comments. In addition, we also use additional attributes such as skin type, skin problems, brand name, and product price. Experiments show that the use of additional attributes significantly improves model performance, with an Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.3039.

The World Health Organization (WHO) states that 40% of blindness cases in the world are caused by cataracts. The rate of blindness caused by cataracts in developed countries is 5% while for countries and/or remote areas it is as high as 50%. This leads to a decrease in the productivity level of the society. Therefore, early detection plays an important role in this regard as it can help patients recognize the cataract at an early stage and take action according to the level of cataract experienced. The purpose of this study is to create an automated model to detect and classify cataracts into four conditions, normal, immature, mature, and hypermature using machine learning algorithms. In order to obtain an optimal model to detecting and classifying cataract, this study compares the performance of two machine learning algorithms, Convolutional Neural Network with the proposed layer and K-Nearest Neighbor. In this study, the dataset used was 2000 fundus images which is divided into 1600 training data images and 400 test data images taken from Cicendo Hospital, Garut, West Java, Indonesia. In the previous study, the cataract classification and detection system were carried out using a 3-Layer Convolutional Neural Network by classifying two conditions, normal and cataract with an accuracy value of 95%. Model performance is showed by confusion matrix analysis which includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score. The best performance is obtained when using 5-Layer Convolutional Neural Network with 98% system accuracy with hyperparameter 100 of epoch, 64 of batch size, and 0.001 of learning rate. Meanwhile, the system accuracy obtained by the K-NN method is 97% with Euclidean Distance, k = 3 and 0° of angle orientation.

To address this, we developed a water quality prediction system (WaQuPs), a sophisticated solution tackling the intricacies of water quality assessment. WaQuPs employs advanced machine learning, including an ensemble learning model, categorizing water quality into nuanced levels: potable, lightly polluted, moderately polluted, and heavily polluted. To ensure rapid and precise dissemination of information, WaQuPs integrates an Internet of Things (IoT)-based communication protocol for the efficient delivery of detected water quality results. In its development, we utilized advanced techniques, such as random oversampling (ROS) for dataset balance. We used a correlation coefficient to select relevant features for the ensemble learning algorithm based on the Random Forest algorithm. Further enhancements were made through hyperparameter tuning to improve the prediction accuracy. WaQuPs exhibited impressive metrics, achieving an accuracy of 83%, precision of 82%, recall of 83%, and an F1-score of 82%.

Breaths per minute refer to the number of breaths taken by a person in one minute. The current clinical respiratory rate calculation method, i.e., a standard calculation by counting the number of chest movements, can cause patient discomfort, bias in counting, and waste the nurse’s time. This study aims to develop a tool for measuring respiratory rate by recording a one-minute photoplethysmography (PPG) signal non-invasively that is more comfortable and easier to use. The PPG signal obtained is first processed to remove unnecessary signal frequencies. The developed algorithm counts the number of peaks in the PPG signal to calculate the respiratory rate. It employs Zero-Phase Filtering to remove noise and motion artifacts (MA) on the signal to calculate the number of peaks in one minute. The device is designed using the MAX30102 sensor, XIAO ESP32-C3 controller, and TFT OLED display to show the measurement value. This tool uses a 3D case and Velcro tape on the sensor to reduce the possibility of a Motion Artifact appearing in the signal. The respiratory rate prediction test results obtained more than 94% accuracy with a maximum error of 3 BrPM in five subjects aged 15–48 years who were in good health. Based on the results, measuring respiratory rate from the PPG signal with a wearable device design can be a quite effective non-invasive solution and contribute to the medical world for measuring vital signs. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

SQL Injection is a cyberattack that exploits the weakness of web applications to access data in the database illegally. WAF is one of the security systems used to protect web applications from SQL injection. WAF is a security system that is easy to integrate with the web server, has a minimal cost, and is easy to configure. SQL injection commonly uses a fuzzing method to attack web applications, but this method is ineffective in bypassing WAF. However, attackers develop SQL injection to exploit vulnerabilities in a web application. This attack is also effective in bypassing WAF. Therefore, this research proposed adversary simulation to take a lesson learned from SQL injection attacks using a genetic algorithm. The lesson learned can be used as a detection strategy against SQL injection attacks using genetic algorithms. This research simulates the attack on some familiar environments in web application testing frameworks and WAF products. Based on the simulation result, the genetic algorithm has a high number of total payload successes in processing SQL injection compared to traditional fuzzing and Cartesian product method. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

Many people are starting to be aware of their own health. However, they do not understand about correct and safe workout movements. Therefore, we want to classify workout movements with a machine learning model using the Convolutional Neural Network algorithm and compare multiple hyperparameter combinations to achieve optimal outcomes, allowing developers to deploy it on websites and applications. By evaluating all hyperparameters, this research aims to optimize model performance in the domain of workout movement classification. In this study there are 22 classes containing workout movements that focus on weightlifting exercises. The dataset was obtained from a downloaded YouTube video that the author subsequently divided into multiple frames. The dataset was splitted into 90% training and 10% validation. To achieve optimal results, the authors examine the impact of batch size, learning rate, and optimizer on the accuracy parameter of the model. The dataset will be trained using InceptionV3 CNN model architecture. The result shows adaptive optimizers like Adam, RMSprop, and AdamW outperformed basic optimizers like SGD and AdaGrad, suggesting that dynamically adjusting learning rates based on gradient information is more effective. A learning rate of 0.001 paired with a high batch size yielded superior results compared to other hyperparameter combinations when training the InceptionV3 model on this dataset.

SmartPLS-4.1 was used to test the measurement and structural model. A total of 307 questionnaires were used for the data analysis. Findings: This research presents the contrasting results of employee orientations with voice behavior. Results support the direct relationship between paranoid arousal and promotive-prohibitive voice behaviors. However, no support was found for approach-avoidance orientation and promotive-prohibitive voice behaviors. Practical implications: Employees' ability to voice-out in organizations depends on several motivational factors, consolidated into three areas – organizational culture, leadership, and individual traits. Organizations must implement a culture of transparency and open communication. Participative and inclusive leadership styles increase the quality of relationships with employees, stimulating a promotive voice. A support system for employees is needed to advance in their careers, increasing promotive behaviors.

In the background of FL research, it was observed that previous frameworks often neglected participant privacy, a critical aspect not aligned with the core FL concept. Additionally, there was room for improving the efficiency of existing frameworks. PureFed addresses these shortcomings by offering participants the flexibility to initiate FL tasks or join existing ones without sharing any private data and removing unnecessary actions that led to an inefficient system. Leveraging blockchain technology, it employs smart contracts to ensure traceability and immutability, enhancing the security of the framework. Additionally, PureFed employs symmetric key encryption and dual digital signature mechanisms using ECDSA to guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of shared models. To expedite model convergence, PureFed incorporates a dynamic aggregation scheme, selecting the most suitable model from three distinct techniques: FedAvg, accuracy-based, and loss-based. Furthermore, the framework introduces a dynamic incentive and punishment mechanism to incentivize collaboration and maintain trust. Extensive performance evaluations reveal PureFed's significant advantages. It outperforms its counterparts by 63.39% and 67.72% in terms of smart contract deployment and interaction gas costs, respectively. Lastly, scalability analyses indicate PureFed's ability to adapt efficiently, achieving target accuracy in fewer rounds.  © 2013 IEEE."

However, until now no one has reviewed the previous paper review using the SMS and SLR methods. The SMS method is quantitative which directs the paper collection to the intended research area so it can be mapped properly. SMS is the process of identifying, categorizing, and analyzing existing literature that is relevant to a certain research topic. Meanwhile, the SLR method is qualitative which makes paper discussions sharper and more focused. SLR is the process of collecting and critically analyzing multiple research studies or papers through a systematic process. It aims to synthesize the findings of the studies and conclude the state of the art on the topic.

The discussion includes research developments and topic areas of indoor tag localization from 2017-2022, trends in the use of UWB in indoor tag localization research, issues and metrics that are carried out in indoor tag localization research, and opportunities for future research. Literacy results show that machine learning, filtering, and sensor fusion are topic areas that are currently being researched on UWB indoor tag localization.

This approach places significant emphasis on waste reduction and enhancing waste recovery through rearing of maggots, notably maggots of BSF (Hermetia illucens). The quantity of eggs produced are contingent on environmental conditions within the breeding facility. An increase in fly egg production correlates with a greater yield of maggots and an elevated consumption of waste materials. Nevertheless, this research assumes critical importance of generating a substantial volume of BSF eggs by fortifying the resilience of the BSF breeding environment through the deployment of sensor nodes, ESP8266-based networks and Antares. This augmentation facilitates the uninterrupted egg-laying process by flies, unaffected by their immediate surroundings. The research methodology adopted here strives to optimize the production output of BSF eggs via the implementation of an Internet of Things (IoT) system built in the Arduino Uno, coupled with the utilization of the ESP9266 system. The temperature range produced in this study was 23.5 to 31 degrees Celsius, with humidity levels between 53.1% and 76.4%.

By utilizing a weighted mixed sensitivity control, this study aims to amplify the robustness of a noninverting buck-boost converter integrated photovoltaic system in addressing the uncertainties and disturbances arising from simultaneous fluctuations in irradiance, temperature, and load. The robust control algorithm was formulated by employing frequency-weighting functions and imposing a requirement for the minimum norm of the transformation matrix to achieve robust performance and robust stability. Furthermore, the involvement of reference models in a robust control synthesis offered additional advantages in enhancing the damping of the system. Consequently, the entire design configuration could effectively establish the converter robustness against both generation and load intermittencies occurring simultaneously.

Moreover, large-scale phenomena, such as the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO), influence the rainfall variability in mountainous areas. In this study, we investigated the interaction between those multiscale prosecutors, orography, and MJO, in modulating diurnal rainfall variability over the mountainous region of West Sumatra. We utilized MJO indices, the Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), and Convective Inhibition (CINH) data spanning 21 years (2001–2022) at three locations surrounding the mountains to explore their role in rainfall variability. These three locations vary in elevation: the windward side (L1), the mountaintop (L2), and the leeward side (L3). Our findings indicate that elevation influences rainfall, leading to varying rainfall intensities across the three locations. Rainfall was higher over L2 than over L1 and L2, except during the night when it was higher over L1 than L2. Furthermore, we observed that enhanced rainfall over L2 coincided with lower CAPE and CINH values, while reduced rainfall over L3 occurred when CAPE and CINH values were higher. Moreover, the results also showed that the effect of the MJO on rainfall depended on the phase of the MJO. MJO-3 has tended to increase precipitation over all locations, while MJO-4 reduced precipitation, particularly during the day. Analyzing the correlation between the MJO and the CAPE, we discovered that the MJO Phase 3 (MJO-3) reduced CAPE, and this reduction was more pronounced in Phase 4 (MJO-4), except over L3. Similarly, investigating the correlation between the MJO and the CINH, we observed that MJO-3 reduced CINH, while MJO-4 increased CINH. Hence, the reduction (increase) of CINH during MJO-3 (MJO-4) might explain the increase (decrease) of rainfall. The results could be important in understanding the effects of MJO-topography interaction on rainfall variability over the region. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

Taekwondo activities are among those that cannot be performed as WFH. The COVID-19 epidemic disrupted regular Taekwondo training, necessitating autonomous practice at home. However, without a trainer's presence, technical errors in Taekwondo kicks could occur. The research presents an automated system utilizing an IMU sensor and SVM for Taekwondo kick classification, empowering athletes to improve their movements independently. Type of kicks that can be classified are Eolgol Ap Chagi, Momtong Ap Chagi, Eolgol Dollyo Chagi, Momtong Dollyo Chagi, and Dwi Chagi. Because it is a basic kick that must be mastered by Taekwondo Athletes. When using tools, taekwondo athletes can move more quickly, thanks to direct implementation on compact devices. Consequently, a simple machine-learning model with the fewest input characteristics is required. On the Arduino Nano 33 BLE, the LSM9DS IMU sensor was used to collect the data. The dataset goes through a cleansing procedure before being labelled and trained, which comes before pre-processing. Three options that may have been employed are SVM, RBF, and DT. In this study, the micromlgen library will be used. Consequently, this work employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) methodology. Mean, median, max, min, and variance are the five features used in the pre-processing technique. The median and variance properties are used to get an accuracy of 99.35%. The experimental findings demonstrate that the SVM algorithm successfully categorizes the different kinds of taekwondo kicks. The developed technology serves as a valuable tool for Taekwondo athletes, providing a means to enhance their skills through self-guided practice during situations like the COVID-19 pandemic. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

In the majority of countries around the world, it is the most significant occupation for many families. Unfortunately, farmers, particularly in oil palm plantations, continue to rely on age-old practices. One of the key elements in achieving high and long-term oil palm production on peat is the adoption of efficient precision water management. In essence, this means maintaining the water table at the necessary depth. Because of the peat's persistently low water table, oil palm productivity has sharply decreased. In this work, an Internet of Things (IoT) for precision agriculture monitoring is developed using a long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN) algorithm. Based on an approach point of view, a LoRaWAN is a long-range, low-power, low-bitrate wireless telecommunications system meant to be used as part of the Internet of Things architecture. The end devices link to gateways through a single wireless hop using LoRaWAN. These gateways function as transparent bridges, relaying messages from the end devices to a central network server.

However, one of the essential steps in developing wind energy projects is finding suitable sites for wind farms, which involves understanding the nature of wind speed, wind direction, terrain, and environmental impacts. To predict the wind energy production over the expected lifespan of a wind farm, vertical wind speed extrapolation to the hub height of the wind turbine is necessary. Therefore, this study presents a comprehensive evaluation of seven statistical approaches for vertical wind speed extrapolation, including Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Regression Tree (RT), and Ensemble Regression (ER). The accuracy of these methods is assessed using performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Normalized RMSE (NRMSE), Normalized MSE (NMSE), Mean Bias Error (MBE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Percentage Error (MPE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE), and R-squared (R2).

A person’s brain health can be determined by monitoring brain activity used EEG technique. It has been demonstrated that EEG signals can be used as a diagnostic tool in evaluating individuals with alcoholism. Using the proper diagnostic method for EEG signals, the individual evaluating under alcoholism has been demonstrated. EEG signals record the brain’s electrical activity, measured from the scalp. The measurements obtained from the EEG are used to confirm or rule out conditions such as alcoholism. Alcohol consumption is associated with specific patterns of brain electrical activity in adults, and the brain activity of individuals with alcoholism differs from non-alcoholics in several ways. This study proposes a feature extraction method for multichannel EEG signals using texture analysis for alcoholic and non-alcoholic classification. Multichannel EEG signal is treated as an image and processed using the texture analysis method. Then it is classified using an artificial neural network. The highest accuracy is achieved using the GLDM feature extraction method at a distance of 3 and an angle of 0°, resulting in an accuracy rate of 93.9%. The method used proved to be higher than previous studies using similar methods.

Two cases of strong geomagnetic storms on March 17, 2015, and April 24, 2023, will be discussed. This study used ionospheric observation data foF2, TEC, and S4 index; geomagnetic activity of SYMH-H, AE index, and Dst index; and the north–south component of interplanetary magnetic field and interplanetary electric field dawn-dusk component. From the TEC data, the vertical TEC were calculated and then the mean VTEC values for the five geomagnetically quiet days in the month associated with the two storm events were calculated. The deviation of VTEC from the mean during geomagnetically quiet days for both storms shows a decreasing of VTEC values about 10 h after the minimum values of Dst index. Also, during the SSC of March 17, 2015, storm, a large negative deviation in the VTEC data is observed, while for the April 24, 2023, storm, only a slight increase is observed. An increase in the S4 index occurred during the recovery period of the April 2023 storm but not occurred for March 2015 storm. Our tentative conclusion is that the increase in the S4 index during the recovery phase of the magnetic storm may be due to the prevention of scintillation as a consequence of increased magnetic activity in the mid-latitudes. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

The first model processes dynamic patterns in PPG signals, while the second model incorporates physiological parameters. Both models are connected through a series of dense layers. To prepare the datasets for the GRU framework, rigorous preprocessing was conducted. This resulted in a robust architecture capable of accurately predicting systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Tablets have various technical specifications which are often difficult to understand for the public, making it challenging for them to determine what they need based on those technical specifications. Therefore, a tablet conversational recommender system (CRS) based on product functional requirements is needed to educate users through conversational interaction. Some previous works have developed CRS framework based on functional requirements. In this paper, we utilize that framework and propose an ontology to build a CRS in tablet domain. The CRS interacts with users to gather their preferences regarding product functional requirements (e.g. a user needs a tablet to edit photos), then it recommends tablet products that meet those functional requirements. On the other hand, ontology is used to map functional requirements to the technical specifications of tablet products. This system is evaluated using accuracy metrics (performance-based evaluation) and user satisfaction evaluation. The evaluation results showed that the system achieves a recommendation accuracy of 95.36% with positive user satisfaction feedback. These results show that the system is effective in providing tablet product recommendations based on user functional requirements. © 2024 IEEE."

The optimization process involves two sequential steps: the primary reference in the first step is the finest swarm member, while in the second step, it is the mean of all finer swarm members plus the finest one. This primary reference is then combined with a randomly chosen solution within the space, serving as the secondary reference. SSA undergoes evaluation in two contexts. The first involves assessing its performance using a set of 23 classic functions as a theoretical use case. The second involves tackling the economic load dispatch problem (ELD), a practical use case featuring a system with 13 generators of various energy resources.

Alzheimer's is one of the main problems in elderly people throughout the world. Early detection of Alzheimer's is critical because it allows for better intervention and management to slow the progression of the disease. Cognitive testing and monitoring behavioral changes are the main screening tools for AD. Brain scans using technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) are the gold standard in AD diagnosis. Such imaging can detect structural or metabolic brain changes associated with Alzheimer's. The expertise and experience of medical experts as well as image quality greatly influence detection accuracy. Therefore, in this study, an automatic AD detection method based on MRI images using several neural network architectures is proposed. The proposed system is employed for the classification of non-demented, very mild, mild, and moderate AD.

The aim of developing the antenna is by modifying the change in position and shape of the antenna to get a large gain with a minimum value of 25 dB. This development is crucial for the use of Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR). The design of the antenna used in this study is to improve the performance of modifying conventional dipole antennas to become collinear arrays. Collinear array antennas involve modifying dipole arms to form an array, incorporating a coupling effect on both the positive and negative arms, and strategically rotating the vertical placement by 180 degrees to maximize the resulting gain. The study involved three types of antenna arrays, each consisting of eight antennas: Mode A, unidirectional with opposite poles; Mode A, not unidirectional with opposite poles; and Mode B, unidirectional with opposite poles. Early research made comparisons of polar differences with polar similarities. For the results of a single polar difference antenna Mode A and B, where Mode A produces S11-26.884 dB with Gains 3.825 dB, Mode B produces S11-20.408 dB with Gains 2.364 dB, for research on array antennas, it was carried out in stages, with as many as 8 array antennas, without reflectors and with reflectors.

The Multipath Transmission Control Protocol (MPTCP) supports this type of connection, but a fairness issue emerges when a multi-path host shares a bottleneck link with regular single-path hosts. To deal with this issue, this paper proposes an enhanced MPTCP (eMPTCP) that uses a throughput adjustment to estimate bandwidth based on TCP Westwood+ congestion control. By decreasing each subflow traffic on the multi-path, the proposed eMPTCP achieves fairness in shared links. The simulation conducted using network simulator 2 (ns2) represents the mobile conditions of mobile data air interface, and the results demonstrate that eMPTCP outperforms standard congestion control in achieving connection resilience. © 2024 University of Bahrain.

The conventional process, reliant on operator efforts, proves costly, time-consuming, and energy intensive. To address this, the employment of deep learning models such as DeepLab V3+ are done, leveraging encoders like ResNet 50, ResNet 101, and MobileNet V2, known for their effectiveness in deep learning applications. Although Deep Learning has demonstrated faster and more automated road extraction, the bottleneck persists in the manual creation of training data through road annotations by operators. Our research focuses on accelerating road extraction by incorporating enhanced annotations from Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) along with organic annotations into the training data to expedite dataset creation while ensuring extraction model accuracy. Specifically, we investigate the optimal ratio of synthetic to organic annotations that yields the highest road extraction accuracy. Moreover, we enhance OBIA-derived road annotations and regulate their integration into the training data. Our findings reveal an optimal composition of 25% for OBIA annotations and 50% for improved OBIA annotations, as exceeding these numbers results in diminished model performance. Significantly, the further improvement of OBIA annotations substantially boosts model performance metrics exemplified in the use of 100% composition in training data. On average, each model produces Pixel Accuracy of 0.942, IoUr of 0.012, mean IoU of 0.477, and Dice Score of 0.495 for every use of 100% OBIA annotations in the training data. Improvement in model performance evaluation metrics occurs when using 100% improved OBIA annotations in the training data where on average each model produces Pixel Accuracy values of 0.954, IoUr of 0.433, mean IoU of 0.692, and Dice Score of 0.771. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method, indicating a reduction in the time required to prepare Deep Learning datasets, reducing the number of organic annotations required to as little as 50% while maintaining model performance by leveraging OBIA road annotations as training data.  © 2024 The Authors."

However, in general, the athlete’s speed and quickness measurements are still done manually with a stopwatch, and then the results are written down in a book or paper. This study proposes a Quickness Aspect Talent Identification (QATI) system that uses Internet of Things (IoT) technology to identify athlete talent for quickness. This system is designed to obtain athlete quickness data by monitoring their movements through sensors placed at predetermined points and connected to a database via the Internet. The QATI system can help identify athletes that traditional talent identification methods might miss. The QATI system comprises four nodes, one controller, and a website-based information system. The node serves as an athlete’s goal point, which can be placed at four points. The controller will set the on–off combination on the node with an adjustable duration or run with a random algorithm. NodeMCU sends time measurement results to a Wifi or Bluetooth network server. The measurement results from each sensor on the node will appear on the website that has been created. The QATI application is proven to perform several configurations such as training mode, delay between devices, duration of on, the distance the device detects, and viewing indicators of the number of connected sensors.

The economic assessment shows a positive trend, with a net present value of $11.9 million, an internal rate of return of 33.09%, and a payback period of 3 years. However, 142 gNodeBs require substantial upfront investments of $2.7 million per site. In addition, the number of gNodeB is identified as the most sensitive parameter influencing project feasibility. While deploying 5G at 700 MHz offers good propagation and indoor penetration to serve Bandung, significant infrastructure funds are needed. By adopting long-term strategies, telecom operators can realize the technological and economic potential of 5G in Indonesian cities. © 2024 by the authors."

The conventional maintenance method lacks accuracy, is less efficient, and has high labor costs. This study developed a cost-effective and accurate fault diagnosis (FD) method based on current data to increase the overall efficiency of RPM maintenance. The FD method for RPM equipment discussed in this paper consists of three working conditions: normal, working, and failure. The method was proposed based on time-series current signals, which were gathered when the RPM was in operation. Time-series data were extracted and filtered using time-domain feature extraction based on scalable hypothesis testing. The selected features became the datasets for machine learning modeling. Six machine learning algorithms were compared in order to find the algorithm with the best FD accuracy. The results showed 100% accuracy for the Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms in the FD method. The results of the FD method could be important for maintenance teams in determining suitable maintenance activities based on RPM working conditions. © 2023 by the authors."

Femtocells, as a solution to the increasing demand for high-quality indoor network coverage, face challenges in power management and interference mitigation. Our proposed model addresses these issues, providing a sophisticated algorithmic approach that ensures high SINR levels without a proportional increase in power usage. Through a series of simulations, the model's performance was evaluated against existing power management techniques. The results, delineated across several tables, revealed that the proposed model consistently achieved and often surpassed targeted SINR levels with modest power consumption increments, even at high targets. Notably, at a SINR target of 20, the model sustained a high SINR of 23.62 while maintaining a reasonable energy profile. Additionally, the model exhibited exceptional operational efficiency, characterized by low execution times and rapid convergence rates, across varying network conditions. This responsiveness is essential for adapting to user mobility and varying traffic patterns, particularly in dense urban settings and during peak usage periods.  © 2013 IEEE."

Conventional sensor-based monitoring systems have limitations in accurately detecting an infant’s condition and position. This research proposes a deep learning algorithm method as an alternative to sensors. The deep learning algorithm will be integrated with a camera to assess the infant’s position and condition using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method. To enhance performance, a development board integrated with a Video Graphic Array (VGA) is utilized to accelerate the processing time of the deep learning method, and the CNN model is simplified using the MobileNetv2 architecture to reduce model weight. Testing with various scenarios, including an infant in potentially hazardous positions (i.e., prone, covered by an obstacle, or standing near a fence) and an infant in safe positions, achieved an accuracy of 94%. This indicates that the model can effectively identify the infant’s position and determine their well-being. Additionally, the Frame Per Second (FPS) results of 20 demonstrate real-time infant supervision capabilities, allowing for timely intervention in case of any potential risks.

In this paper, we aim to explore the performance of the indoor positioning system (IPS) using Wi-Fi signals. Three common machine learning models, linear regression, decision trees, and K-nearest neighbour (KNN) have been proposed for indoor positioning using the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). This study also includes the finding of the K value for the optimum performance of the KNN model in IPS. By comparing the experimental results of these two models, the optimised KNN model with K = 19 outperformed the linear regression and decision trees models with an accuracy of 96% in just 0.9 min, compared with an accuracy of 70 and 82% for the linear regression and decision trees models respectfully in three minutes.

To overcome this problem, one promising and state-of-the-art method is applying a multicarrier modulation technique. Currently, the use of multi-carrier modulation technique is using a single transmission frequency with a bandwidth is no more than 24 kHz in real-world implementation. However, based on the range of the minimum and maximum ionospheric plasma frequency values, which could be in the MHz range, the use of these values as the main bandwidth in multi-carrier modulation techniques can optimize the use of available channel capacity. In this paper, we propose a multi-carrier modulation technique in combination with a model variation of Lowest Usable Frequency (LUF) and Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF) values as the main bandwidth to optimize the use of available channel capacity while also maintaining its reliability by following the variation of the ionosphere plasma frequency. To analyze its capacity and reliability, we performed a numeric simulation using a LUF-MUF model based on Long Short Term- Memory (LSTM) and Advanced Stand Alone Prediction System (ASAPS) in Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS) propagation mode with the assumption of perfect synchronization between transmitter and receiver with no Doppler and no time offsets. The results show the achievement of the ergodic channel capacity varies for every hour of the day, with values in the range of 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps with 0 to 20 dB SNR. Meanwhile, the reliability of the system is in the range of 8% to 100% for every hour of one day based on two different Mode Reliability calculation scenarios. The results also show that channel capacity and system reliability optimization are determined by the accuracy of the LUF-MUF model.  © 2024 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers."

However, the challenges include creating a suitable ontology, updating the ontology regularly, and limited camera data. To address these issues, we propose an ontology-based camera recommender system that not only provides accurate and personalized guidance to users but can also provide added value to camera manufacturers in increasing product sales. Furthermore, this research introduces a knowledge ontology update and implementation of the Conversational Recommender System (CRS) framework in the camera domain, we propose using a collaborative filtering method to improve the recommendation accuracy. The results are expected to provide better guidance to users in selecting cameras according to their functional needs.

In this paper, we explore the efficacy of self-supervised learning techniques for malware classification. We propose MalSSL, a self-supervised learning-based method utilizing image representation to classify malware. MalSSL classifies unlabeled malware images using contrastive learning and data augmentation. The model is initially trained on an unlabeled Imagenette dataset as a pretext task and subsequently retrained on an unlabeled malware dataset in downstream tasks. Two downstream tasks were employed to evaluate the system: 1) malware family classification and 2) malware benign classification. The obtained results include an accuracy of 98.4% for the malware family classification experiment on the Malimg dataset and an accuracy of 96.2% for the malware and benign dataset (Maldeb dataset). Our findings suggest that the proposed system accurately classifies malware without the need for labeled data, displaying higher accuracy compared to other self-supervised methods.

SBA is developed mainly based on the non-free-lunch (NFL) doctrine, which mentions the non-existence of any general optimizer appropriate to answer all varieties of problems. The construction of SBA is based on splitting the swarm into two equal-sized swarms to diversify the searching process while performing intensification within the subswarms. There are two types of finest swarm members: the finest swarm member for the whole swarm and the finest swarm member in every sub-swarm. There are four directed searches performed in every iteration: (1) search toward the finest swarm member, (2) search toward the finest sub-swarm member, (3) search toward the middle between two finest sub-swarm members, and (4) search relative to the randomly picked swarm member from another sub-swarm. The performance of SBA is assessed through two assessments with a set of 23 functions representing the optimization problem. In the benchmark assessment, SBA is contended with five metaheuristics: northern goshawk optimization (NGO), language education optimization (LEO), coati optimization algorithm (COA), fully informed search algorithm (FISA), and total interaction algorithm (TIA). The result presents the superiority of SBA among its contenders by being better than NGO, LEO, COA, FISA, and TIA in 21, 16, 16, 21, and 18 functions.

In panel data regression, the researchers implemented three distinct models: the random effect model, the fixed effect model, and the common pooled model. The data were provided in two columns, one with control variables and one without control variables. This study also presents empirical evidence that ownership of shares by directors and majority shareholders was significant, implying that an increased number of shares possessed by directors and high majority shareholders would reduce earnings management. While the frequency of board meetings had no significant moderating effect on the relationship between director share ownership and earnings management, it did play a significant moderating role in the relationship between directors’ proportion as majority shareholders and earnings management. Finally, the contribution of these empirical findings as research makes a valuable addition to the existing body of academic literature on earnings management, particularly within the context of the Iraq earnings management scenarios. It also has the potential to make a meaningful contribution towards mitigating the prevalence of earnings management practices.

One of the instruments developed to monitor solar activity is the Callisto spectrometer developed by ETH Zurich, Switzerland. This instrument is spread in many countries, collaborating in the e-Callisto network. To build this system, it is necessary to conduct a radio frequency spectrum survey to see whether the spectrum conditions in a certain place allow Callisto to be installed or not. In this study, a radio frequency spectrum survey was conducted at Telkom University, Bandung, Indonesia. The RF signal strength in several frequency bands protected for radio astronomy observations is recorded. The obtained data was analyzed by using Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) analysis to determine whether solar activity monitoring can be carried out at this location, within the Callisto frequency range. Observational results show that the signal level in all investigated frequency bands is relatively low, well below − 85 dBm for all bands, and with 80% samples are lower than − 100 dBm.

Besides, the strict dimension mapping has been implemented in many population-based metaheuristics, especially the swarm-based metaheuristics. Regarding this problem, this paper proposes a new swarm-based metaheuristics called focus and shake algorithm (FSA). FSA has novel approach in the dimension mapping between the agent and its reference during the directed motion. It combines the strict dimension mapping called as focus approach and the randomized dimension mapping called as shake approach to enhance its exploration ability. FSA deploys two directed motions based on two references. The first reference is constructed based on the balance mixture between two finer agents while the second reference is constructed based on the balance mixture of the finest agent and a randomly picked agent. In the competing assessment, FSA competes with five brand new swarm-based metaheuristics: migration algorithm (MA), total interaction algorithm (TIA), lyrebird optimization algorithm (LOA), osprey optimization algorithm (OOA), and kookaburra optimization algorithm (KOA). The result exhibits that FSA is finer than MA, TIA, LOA, OOA, and KOA in 19, 21, 21, 19, and 20 functions out of 23 functions respectively.

Based on the findings of the driving test conducted in the Kiaracondong sub-district, the KPI target was not fulfilled for the RSRP, SINR, and Throughput parameters. Therefore, this study primarily focuses on the physical tuning optimization using the Automatic Cell Planning (ACP) method for the LTE wireless network optimization. To assess the quality of the LTE network before and after optimization, the results of the ACP optimization simulation will be compared with the results of the existing or non-ACP site simulation and the results of the operator's ACP implementation. As a result, Area 1 has an average RSRP of-72.79 dBm, area 2-73.17 dBm, and area 3-68.22 dBm. Additionally, the average SINR in areas 1,2 and 3 is 8 dB, 6.58 dB, and 8.17 dB, respectively. The average downlink throughput in area 1 is 42652.66 Kbps, area 2 is 34420.88 Kbps, and area 3 is 43882.92 Kbps. Finally, the average throughput uplink for areas 1 to 3 is 51651.24 Kbps, 47895.99 Kbps, and 49648.84 Kbps, respectively. © 2024, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved."

In this paper, a dual-band microstrip patch antenna, with the ability to tune the resonant frequency in one band while maintaining it in the other band, is proposed. The antenna comprises two main structures arranged in a stack and is responsible for producing two different resonant frequencies. The square microstrip patch located on the top layer plays a role in producing high resonant frequencies, while the square ring element array integrated with varactor diodes in the middle layer plays a role in producing low resonant frequencies and provides a frequency tuning function.

Pathologists encounter many challenges that may result in incorrect diagnoses, such as the heterogeneous shape and irregular appearance of MTB, low-quality ZN staining, and errors in in scanning each of the field of view (FoV) using a conventional microscope. Additionally, multiple manual observations may cause fatigue that leads to human error. Several studies have created microscopic imaging databases of sputum samples, aiding researchers in creating computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for tuberculosis, which is a promising method that offers timely, reliable, and repeatable assistance. Nevertheless, the implementation of CAD systems for TB diagnosis remains an area of ongoing research and development owing to the lack of microscopic image datasets of sputum samples, which represent whole-slide imaging (WSI) that follows the WHO (World Health Organization) regulations. To address this issue, this study developed a novel digitized microscopic image from sputum smear samples of Indonesian patients in the WSI that conform to the WHO regulation. These images are collected as a Microscopic Imaging Database of Tuberculosis Indonesia (MIDTI). This study also proposed a method based on the YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once seventh version) algorithm to develop a CAD for tuberculosis diagnosis by classifying ZN-stained sputum smear samples into International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) grades, which has never been revealed in any previous studies.  © 2013 IEEE."

SMA Negeri 1 Kediri Tabanan currently utilizes a Google Form-based tracer study to gather data from the alums. However, the low participation rate in completing the data collection needs to improve the evaluation of educational programs and the improvement of the school curriculum. Additionally, the school needs more information regarding the success of its students. This is because application users, namely alums, lack the motivation to complete the tracer study form. Moreover, the Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS) measures user motivation in the tracer study of SMAN 1 Kediri Tabanan in four categories: intrinsic motivation, external regulation, identified regulation, and amotivation. Therefore, this research proposes a solution in the form of a redesign of a web-based tracer study using gamification. The aim of applying gamification is to enhance alum's motivation in filling out the tracer study form, which SIMS will subsequently measure to compare motivation scores. The SIMS results demonstrate that gamification elements can augment user motivation in the tracer study application.

To ease this problem, the Indonesian government has attempted to empower women ex-migrant workers by prohibiting them from returning to work in the domestic sector abroad. This empowerment program was implemented through the sustainability training program of the Community of Migrant Worker’s Families (KKBM) from 2017 to 2019. The government hoped that by focusing on entrepreneurship, former migrant laborers would be able to achieve financial independence. Most of them, however, decided to return to their previous jobs or to work overseas after completing the training. By using a qualitative case study method, this study sought to assess communication strategies and offer solutions; it was focused on the period from March 2019 to October 2019, after the program had ended. The results showed that the bottom-up communication strategy for the empowerment program through KKBM did not work well because the government’s communication in the program implementation was conducted vertically and one-way without fully involving women ex-migrant workers or emphasizing the program goals. In addition, the sustainability of the program was not carried out appropriately. Instead, it was only focused on low-power community organizers. © (2024), (Bridgewater State College).

The emergence of patchouli leaf disease significantly reduced the production of wet, dry, oil, and patchouli alcohol. Therefore, selecting patchouli cuttings (seedlings) that are entirely healthy and disease-free is very important to prevent disease transmission from one area to another. In addition, the selection of disease-free seeds is also essential to prevent the use of diseased patchouli plant propagation. So far, the early identification of patchouli plant health is carried out through visual observations by experts using antiviral serum tested in the laboratory. However, this testing process is expensive. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for patchouli leaf diseases. We proposed a system for early identification of whether a patchouli leaf is diseased or healthy. Our CNN model uses three convolution layers, a dense layer, and a dropout layer. We compare the proposed model with well-known models, namely EfficientNetB0, AlexNet, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, and VGG16. The results show that the proposed model outperformed five well-known models as a comparison. It has been confirmed by predicting the new and different testing data.

Previous research has demonstrated variations in the patterns of EEG signals between alcohol-using and non-drinking people. Various techniques, including wavelet and entropy, have been developed to detect alcoholic EEG using event-related potential (ERP) testing. This work proposes a feature extraction technique based on texture analysis for the classification of alcohol EEG signals because ERP-measured EEG often involves many channels. An NxM image is thought to be equivalent to an EEG signal with N channels and a recording duration of M samples. The NxM matrix is formed by channelizing the N-channel EEG signal in this investigation. Normalization is then used to get a matrix value of 0-255 or an 8-bit image in the following step. Five features are measured in four directions, and the Grey Level Difference Matrix (GLDM) approach is utilized for feature extraction. Using five grey-level difference matrix (GLDM) features and linear discriminant analysis as a classifier, the maximum accuracy was achieved at 73.3%. Image processing can still be used to increase accuracy even though the final product is less accurate than the earlier technique. The suggested approach can still be adjusted to work with biomedical signals or image processing techniques like the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). © 2024, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

To make their decisions, they use subjective perceptions of friends or family due to the lack of guidance and limited resources. This increases the risk of dissatisfaction with the work environments. To address these drawbacks, this study presents a personalized career-path recommendation model (CPRM) to provide guidance and help college students choose information technology jobs. The design of the CPRM is based on the personalized Naïve Bayes (p-NB) algorithm with three primary sources: job profiles, personality types, and subjects. The association between personality type and college students was established using samples of 104 computer science students enrolled in private universities in Indonesia. CPRM was implemented as a web-based application. This study evaluated the model by measuring the quality of the recommended items to determine whether the proposed model is well accepted by users. The model considers educational data mining grounded theory (EDM-GT) data integration and hierarchically related concepts. CPRM has been validated by Information Technology (IT) professionals and three psychologists in Indonesia through focus group discussions. The evaluation results showed that more than 83% of respondents were satisfied with the recommendation model. Hence, CPRM can provide automatic academic advisors and guidance to computer science students interested in pursuing careers in IT jobs. The result shows that CPRM is the first career path recommendation model based on EDM-GT to target the computer science community in Indonesia.  © 2013 IEEE."

With the rapid development in the market, we can now choose a variety of specifications, shapes, and models that we may not know. To help us choose the right item, we usually use recommender systems such as conversational recommender systems (CRS). However, most CRS systems use the technical specifications of products as a reference to recommend items to users. Users who do not understand technical specifications and do not follow the development of the items find it difficult to choose an item that suits their needs. To overcome this problem is to directly ask about the functionality needs of users so that the recommender system can recommend items appropriately. This research evaluates an ontology-based CRS system as the main structure of the system, then embeds knowledge in it to facilitate conversational interaction with users, provide product recommendations, and explain the results of recommended items in the domain of audio listening devices. System evaluation is based on system performance and user satisfaction, accuracy for system performance gets a value of around 86.57% and gets positive results for user satisfaction.

The training time varies across network sizes, with the size of 16 taking the longest and the size of 64 taking the shortest. Overall, the findings suggest that machine learning can be effectively employed for RBP classification, and that network size plays a role in optimizing performance. © 2024 IEEE."

Indonesia’s experience underscores the complexities and challenges in implementing such projects effectively. A study on the effects of various socio-economic factors on Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Indonesia highlights the significant impact of forest area, urbanization, and industrialization on carbon emissions. A hybrid system consists of PV, a Biogas Generator, and a Wind Turbine that are successfully deployed. However, no economic analysis has been conducted to obtain the best configuration of the hybrid system. We propose to delve into the effective integration combination of hybrid power systems. In this study, we thoroughly analyzed hybrid power systems in underdeveloped areas using the HOMER software. We examined five different hybrid system configurations: Solely biogas, complete generator integration, a biogas and hydrogen combo, biogas coupled with a PV system, and biogas combined with a wind turbine. Our findings indicated varying levels of economic viability, operational performance, and environmental impact across the configurations, providing crucial insights for policymakers and stakeholders in underdeveloped regions like Indonesia. The results showed the Wind-Hydrogen and Hydrogen Only schemes as the most cost-effective, with a Total Net Present Cost (NPC) of $48,969.27 and Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) at $0.218. Moreover, while CO2 emissions were similar across all schemes, around 27,744 kg/year, the All-Generator scheme had slightly higher emissions at 27,667 kg/year but led in electricity production with 29,101 kWh/year. These results underscore the importance of balancing cost, energy output, and environmental impact in hybrid power system schemes for underdeveloped regions. © 2024 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

Usually, it uses medium material that is easily carved to create a high section and a low section (relief). Relief print can also be understood as using the texture of a medium. In designing textile surfaces, block printing is a technique that adapts the principle of relief print with a variety of designs engraved on the medium as a printing plate and then printed onto the fabric's surface. In Indonesia, block printing technique is not widely mastered by textile artisans, but in India this technique is developing as one of the textile industries, famous for its uniqueness in some areas, and its existence is protected by the Kingdom. In general, a variety of typical motifs are produced with this technique, such as geometric motifs, floral motifs such as paisley, and tribal motifs. Utilization of this relief printing principle can not only be developed through various motif designs on block printing plates. However, it can also be developed by utilizing everyday objects with unique textures, such as vegetables. Vegetables in the form of leaves or fruits that we often consume daily have interesting textures or reliefs to be used as textile motif designs if they are well-composed. Based on the block printing technique development, the researchers saw the potential for using this vegetable texture as a novelty of motifs in the textile design scene. This research uses a qualitative method with data collected by literature and studio-based exploration. Therefore, in this study, the author conducted several relief print experiments by exploring the texture of several vegetables and fruits, which then explored the composition of the prints to create interesting motif compositions. This experiment will use vegetable parts as relief printing media, some of which are the texture of leaf waves and veins, the texture of fruit seeds that are still attached, the texture of a cross section of a vegetable, and cross-sectional sections of a collection of the leaf stem. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

Keeping recommendations accurate to users has always been the main topic in recommender systems studies. However, the recommendations that are very accurate at times are not the most useful recommendations to users. Among many aspects, novelty is becoming a more common component of evaluation practice, and explanation can play a useful role. On top of that, a few researchers suggested studying recommender systems from a user-centric perspective. This research performed a user-centric evaluation to examine the influence of novelty and explanation on perceived usefulness using a within-subject design approach. During within-subject design, participants were shown two recommendation list designs from each aspect. Put simply, there are four designs in this study, and then later, participants evaluate the design. The results of the user-centric evaluation were analyzed using a wilcoxon test. The outcome from the test showed that there is no significant difference between the two novelty scenarios on perceived usefulness. On the other hand, there are significant differences between the two explanation scenarios on perceived usefulness. The conclusion of this paper is that both novelty scenarios are useful from the user perspective. In sharp contrast, one of two explanation scenarios has better influence on perceived usefulness and is more helpful based on the user's perspective. © 2024 IEEE."

Prevention of stunting in toddlers is needed to avoid the long-term effects for both the toddlers and the public. Stunting prevention can be done by monitoring the growth of toddlers. Therefore, a system that can predict stunting conditions in toddlers is needed. Machine learning offers many methods that can be used to build a system to predict stunting conditions in toddlers. This research analyzes some machine learning models that are potentially suitable to predict stunting classes, which are K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Ensemble Learning called Boosted KNN (BK). The dataset has an imbalance issue in this research, with the stunting data at only 1% of the total dataset. Therefore, oversampling of the dataset is done by generating a random dataset based on the distribution of the data that are classified as the minority class. The results of elaborating on this oversampling are shown to be satisfying. Applying imbalanced data gives an average of 98% accuracy for all methods used; however, the F-1 score macro average is shown not optimal for each of the methods, with 51.95% for KNN, 52.45% for RF, and 53.55% for BK.

To address these issues, this research introduces a channel multiplexing model for Light Fidelity (Li-Fi) communication, employing movable LED panels. The study evaluates the model’s performance by varying channel number, transmitter half-angle values, and field of view (FOV) parameters over a 3 to 5-meter transmission range. Results demonstrate that the proposed Light Fidelity indoor multiplexing model excels with an inter-channel spacing of 25 nm, particularly for Mux 2x2 and Mux 4x4 schemes. Longer-wavelength channels exhibit lower bit error rates (BER) and superior Q-factor values compared to others. Reliable performance within the 3 to 5-meter range is achieved with transmitter half-angle values of 300 and 450, enhanced by adopting a higher Lambertian order value (m>1) to ensure signal quality with a superior signal-tonoise ratio (SNR). Additionally, employing a FOV of 300 solely complies with the optical communication standard (BER < 10-12) for distances spanning 3 to 5 meters. © (2024), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

This study addresses the complexity by aiming to automatically generate an optimal multi-day travel itinerary that satisfies user interests. The problem is framed as a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window (CVRPTW), and user interests are shaped by attributes such as rating and cost of points of interest (POIs), travel duration, the number of POIs in the itinerary, and penalty attributes (POI penalty and time penalty). The generated solution must adhere to constraints like daily travel duration limits and the operational hours of POIs. To ensure alignment with user interests, the Multi-Utility Attribute Theory (MAUT) is employed as the fitness function. This study proposes a VRP approach utilizing the hybrid Ant Colony System (ACS) and Brainstorm optimization (BSO) algorithm (the hybrid ACS-BSO) for multi-day travel itinerary generation, addressing the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) approach limitations. The hybrid ACS-BSO outperforms conventional algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Tabu Search (TS), and Simulated Annealing (SA), across 5 sets of random POIs with an average fitness value of 0.6704. moreover, the hybrid ACS-BSO outperforms the other conventional algorithms in optimizing each attribute. In terms of travel duration attribute, the hybrid ACS-BSO generate an itinerary requiring only 6 days to visit 40 POIs, while the other algorithms need 7 days. In terms of cost and rating attributes, the hybrid ACS-BSO achieves the best fitness values compared to the others. Furthermore, the hybrid ACS-BSO outperforms the standalone algorithms (ACS and BSO) across varying numbers of POIs, but it faces a maximum 311 seconds running time for 87 POIs, indicating a time complexity weakness. Comparatively, ACS, BSO, and the hybrid ACS-BSO in VRP approach surpass their TSP counterparts, affirming the effectiveness of the VRP approach. © (2024) Intelligent Network and Systems Society."

Despite this, certain PLTUs in Indonesia, including one examined in this research, still rely on manual identification of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and need more data to support forthcoming carbon trading endeavors. To address this gap, this study focuses on developing a predictive model using The Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology to forecast carbon emissions, coal fuel consumption, and gross electricity. The predictive model integrates time series models to forecast each variable, followed by a regression model for carbon emission prediction. Evaluation metrics, including MAE, RMSE, and MAPE, are utilized, and model training employs five machine learning models: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and LightGBM. Results reveal that for PLTU Units 3 and 7, the Linear Regression model performs optimally in time series modeling, whereas for PLTU Unit 8, Random Forest Regression is most effective. Across all units, Linear Regression emerges as the superior model in regression modeling. This study equips PLTUs with predictive insights into carbon emissions, facilitating strategic planning for emission reduction. By considering predicted outcomes of coal fuel consumption and gross electricity alongside carbon emission forecasts, PLTUs can comprehensively assess environmental and financial impacts, guiding effective mitigation strategies. © 2024 The Authors."

The signal is continuously transmitted by separate antennas with microstrip array antenna technology for the transmitter and receiver. The use of new technology allows the manpack radar to detect targets using low transmit power (< 10 W) so that it can operate on batteries. With dimensions of 520 mm (W) x 410 mm (H) x 108 mm (D) and weighing only 15.9 kg, this radar can be easily carried by personnel for maneuvering in the field. Although the dimensions of this manpack radar system are small, it has high detection capability, whereby it can detect drones, humans, small vehicles and large vehicles at ranges of up to 2, 3, and 5 km respectively. In addition, this radar system not only detects targets horizontally, but also vertically so that it can calculate the height of the target. It can also track multiple targets simultaneously and display the parameters of each target, such as distance, speed and altitude. With these aspects, this radar system design is effective for use by Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) personnel in the field to conduct surveillance for supporting combat operations. © (2024), (Science and Technology Research Institute for Defence).

Guard trace structures, which are commonly used for crosstalk reduction on printed circuit board technology, are proposed to be inserted between the array elements for coupling reduction. Two types of guard trace structures, i.e., straight guard traces and serpentine guard traces, were explored, and the effect of using via holes on both types of guard traces was studied. For this purpose, two-element antenna arrays with guard trace structures inserted between array elements were designed and simulated. The simulation results showed that a straight guard trace with vias (straight GTV) and a serpentine guard trace without vias (serpentine GT) could effectively reduce EM coupling between elements of array antennas. To verify the simulation results, prototypes of antenna arrays with straight GTV and serpentine GT were realized and measured. The measurement results showed coupling reductions of 5 dB and 6.4 dB could be achieved when straight GTV and serpentine GT are inserted between two array elements separated by edge-to-edge distances of 4 mm and 9.05 mm, respectively. Therefore, the proposed decoupling technique is suitable for beamforming antenna arrays with a very close distance between array elements. t © 2023 Published by IRCS-ITB,."

As its name suggests, ECOA hybridizes two new metaheuristics, the coati optimization algorithm (COA) and the osprey optimization algorithm (OOA). ECOA is constructed by five searches performed sequentially by the swarm members. The first three are directed searches, while the last two are neighborhood searches. All three directed searches are adopted from COA and OOA. Meanwhile, the four-bordered neighborhood search is developed based on a new approach. During the assessment, ECOA was challenged to overcome the set of 23 functions and contended with five new metaheuristics: total interaction algorithm (TIA), golden search optimization (GSO), average and subtraction-based optimization (ASBO), COA, and OOA. The result shows that ECOA outperforms TIA, GSO, ASBO, COA, and OOA in 16, 23, 18, 21, and 21 functions.

Da'wah is the process of communicating messages related to Islamic teachings and ideologies to others with the intent to transform a person’s or a society’s unfavorable circumstances. This study takes a phenomenological approach to examine the deradicalization communication model of preaching practiced by the Jama’ah Tabligh in the regions of Yala, Southern Thailand. Qualitative analyses reveal that such da‘wah activities in Yala have implications for increased moderation in religiosity and tolerance. The Jama’ah’s preaching model has been more successful in deradicalization compared with the work of former radical movements. In short, da’wah by the Jama’ah is a model of indirect deradicalization in the South Thailand regions. The insights from this finding could help build models for deradicalization based on religious understanding and prevent the emergence of radicalism and terrorism among Muslim communities in Southeast Asia. © AMIC/WKWSCI-NTU 2023."

The problem is that the end device of the Internet of things (IoT), such as NodeMCU as the device target for placing edge computing programs, has limited resources. This paper proposes a Quantized 8-bit K-Nearest Neighbor (Q8KNN), a novel quantization method that performs model compression on KNN with our case study, the smart lighting control systems, using NodeMCU. Firstly, we have created a novel and accurate smart lighting design that we proposed. The design uses edge computing and KNN models to predict the control data. Then we developed a quantization method to make the KNN model fit into the NodeMCU. Finally, we test the performance of our novel compression model using the Accuracy and Compression Ratio (CR) metrics. The test results show that the number of unique values that change due to quantization does not cause a cardinality problem. Then Q8KNN can provide CR up to 1.6 times. With a smaller model size, Q8KNN can increase the number of training samples in the NodeMCU memory. So, using the same model size, the original KNN gives an accuracy of 94% while Q8KNN can provide up to 98%. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Despite the widespread use of resistivity methods, current injection is a critical step in the process of resistivity methods, and the quality of current injection significantly impacts the accuracy of the resistivity measurements. One primary challenge is optimizing current injection techniques to enhance resistivity methods. The developed current injector model for the resistivity meter instrument enhances performance by increasing the voltage source to 400 Volts, extending measurement coverage. It provides three injection current options, 0.5A, 0.8A, and 1A, for efficient accumulator use, considering electrode distances and estimating earth resistance using Contact Resistance Measurement (CRM) to estimate the earth resistance. CRM mode ensures proper electrode connection before injection, thus improving measurement efficiency. The embedded TTGO LoRa ESP32 SX1276 facilitates wireless communication over 1.5 km, addressing challenges in remote and internet-limited areas. The model demonstrates reliability, validity, and durability in CRM mode and current injection measurement. Regarding reliability, we determine the relative error of the model by carrying out measurements repeatedly. In lab-scale testing, the average Relative Error in CRM mode is 0.65%, and in earth resistance measurement testing, it is 1.58%. These relative errors are below the 2% maximum error applied in the “Supersting”, a commercial resistivity instrument. The model's validity is defined by comparing the model with the measuring instrument; we have absolute error. In lab scale testing, the average Absolute Error in CRM mode is 3.08%, and in earth resistance measurement testing, it is 3.73%. The model's durability is tested by injecting current for a minute. After one minute of current injection, the power resistor component's temperature is stable at 30°C. © 2024 by the Sifa Nurpadillah, Willy Anugrah Cahyadi, Husneni Mukhtar, Kusnahadi Susanto, Akhmad Fauzi Ikhsan and Agung Ihwan Nurdin."

WBAN applications use wearable antennas because they have flexible materials and are suitable for telemedicine technology and have many advantages such as small size, lightweight, able to work at a wide enough frequency, easy fabrications, and affordable costs. In this research, the hexagonal patch ultrawide-band monopole planar wearable antenna was designed using Cordura Delinova 2000 textile material for the substrate and copper tape for the groundplane and patch. The Uniplanar Compact Electromagnetic Band Gap (UC-EBG) as a metamaterial was added to the design of the monopole planar antenna in this final project which aims to improve antenna parameters, increase efficiency, and reduce the effects of radiation on the body. From the measurement results on the antenna with the addition of the UC-EBG structure at the bottom of the patch, it produces a 6% fractional bandwidth increase and able to work in the frequency range of 3-10 GHz off-body conditions and 2-11 GHz on-body conditions. In the SAR test at 45 mm, it was found that the value decreased from previously 1.535 W/Kg to 1.31 W/Kg at a frequency of 3.5 GHz and previously from 1.421 to 1.267 W/Kg at a frequency of 5 GHz on a wrist phantom object which is a good value for SAR. The resulting increase in antenna gain after the addition of the UC-EBG structure. The radiation pattern on the antenna is bidirectional.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

The survey method was used, and questionnaires were distributed to users of Deliveree Indonesia services. A sample of 218 respondents and the data were analyzed using the Structural Equation Model (SEM) with SmartPLS 3.0 software. The findings reveal that service quality, perceived value, and customer trust have a positive effect on customer satisfaction. Higher levels of service quality, perceived value, and customer trust lead to greater customer satisfaction. Additionally, perceived value, customer trust, and customer satisfaction also positively impact customer loyalty. Higher levels of perceived value, customer trust, and customer satisfaction increase the likelihood of customers remaining loyal to Deliveree Indonesia's services. However, the research shows that service quality does not have a significant effect on customer loyalty. This may be due to external factors beyond Deliveree Indonesia's control, such as intense market competition, changing consumer preferences, or economic factors that affect customer loyalty. Based on these findings, it is suggested that further research is needed to explore the factors influencing service quality and perceived value. © 2024, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

The use of Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) is based on the requirement for a block-based multi-carrier technology in which each subcarrier is generated with a filter in the form of non-rectangular pulses known as pulse shaping. Meanwhile, Offset QAM (OQAM) is used to achieve better spectral efficiency than QAM and simultaneously reduce the occurrence of ICI and ISI. In this study, the effect of adjusting the roll-off factor value on the pulse shaping filter utilized is examined in order to detect the original signal supplied by the transmitter using two linear equalizations: Zero Forcing (ZF) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE). The results show that the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) used in this study is varied from 0 dB to 15 dB, and the Bit Error Rate (BER) obtained when the SNR is 15 dB on GFDM-OQAM using ZF and MMSE are 0.03872 and 0.01986 respectively. Then this study indicates that the GFDM-OQAM system using MMSE equalization has a better BER value than the GFDM-OQAM system using ZF equalization. In addition, the greater the use of the roll-off factor, the lower the performance of the BER system because there is a greater excess bandwidth which is linear with the magnitude of the roll-off factor. © 2024 by the authors."

The move to cloud computing presents significant opportunities in terms of operational efficiency, scalability, innovation, and improved customer experience. Adopting a cloud model allows organizations to reduce capital investments in physical infrastructure such as servers and data centers and dynamically manage IT resources as needed. But this transition also brings new challenges in terms of infrastructure investment, security, system integration, and changing work culture. A comprehensive cost assessment of cloud computing architectures is currently hampered by a lack of valuation methodologies and a standardized comprehensive total cost model. This issue creates uncertainty around costs and architectural changes in utilizing the information technology infrastructure. The objective of this paper is to explore the various costs and benefits associated with moving an organization's IT infrastructure from on-premises servers to cloud computing. A cost–benefit analysis can be used to understand the costs associated with the benefits received by a company or organization. This makes it easier to decide whether to use cloud computing. These potential benefits include ease of access, increased productivity, time savings, and cost savings.

The risk factors for stroke are the same as heart disease or other blood vessel diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol. One way to prevent stroke is to minimize several diseases that cause clogged or ruptured blood vessels. This study aims to predict the results of the classification of stroke types based on 6 factors, namely age, gender, cholesterol levels, length of stay (LOS), history, and blood sugar levels of stroke patients. The classification method chosen is one part of machine learning, namely the resilient backpropagation neural network (RBNN) because it is in accordance with the type of data used.

However, up to now, there are only a few large Indonesian language datasets accessible for research purposes, including sentiment analysis datasets, where sentiment analysis is considered the most popular task. Objective: The objective of this work is to present sentiment analysis on a large Indonesian product review dataset, employing various features and methods. Two tasks have been implemented: classifying reviews into three classes (positive, negative, neutral), and predicting ratings. Methods: Sentiment analysis was conducted on the FDReview dataset, comprising over 700,000 reviews. The analysis treated sentiment as a classification problem, employing the following methods: Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), LSTM, and BiLSTM. Result: The experimental results indicate that in the comparison of performance using conventional methods, MNB outperformed SVM in rating prediction, whereas SVM exhibited better performance in the review classification task. Additionally, the results demonstrate that the BiLSTM method outperformed all other methods in both tasks. Furthermore, this study includes experiments conducted on balanced and unbalanced small-sized sample datasets. Conclusion: Analysis of the experimental results revealed that the deep learning-based method performed better only in the large dataset setting. Results from the small balanced dataset indicate that conventional machine learning methods exhibit competitive performance compared to deep learning approaches. © 2024 The Authors."

This study investigates the utility of ionosondes in forecasting the incidence of post-sunset ESF in the zonal direction, utilizing observational data obtained from four ionosondes located near the magnetic Equator in Southeast Asia. Data were collected during the equinox seasons (March–April and September–October) between 2003 and 2020. To establish a relationship between the probability of post-sunset ESF occurrence and the evening vertical plasma drift (v), a logistic regression model was employed. Post-sunset ESF occurrence is defined as the presence of ESF during the time window between 19:00 and 21:00 LT, while v is derived from the average time derivative of virtual heights during the interval from 18:30 to 19:00 LT. Results indicate that the probability of post-sunset ESF occurrence approaches zero, signifying that ESF is unlikely to develop when v is negative. Conversely, when v exceeds 30 m/s, the probability of post-sunset ESF occurrence surpasses 0.87, indicating that ESF occurs almost invariably. The likelihood of post-sunset ESF occurrence reaches 1 when v equals or exceeds 40 m/s. Utilizing this model, the study determined that a single ionosonde positioned at the Equator can effectively forecast the incidence of post-sunset ESF up to a longitudinal distance of 30° from its location. The accuracy of ionosondes in predicting post-sunset ESF occurrence above their respective locations is approximately 0.80, with a 10% decrease in accuracy when forecasting ESF occurrence at longitudinal distances of 30°. In conclusion, this study enhances our understanding of the link between the evening vertical plasma drift and the manifestation of post-sunset ESF by leveraging ionosonde data. Furthermore, it provides valuable insights into the recommended coverage range of ionosondes for predicting post-sunset ESF occurrence in the zonal direction, which can be employed to fortify regional space weather services.

The model adeptly distills vital themes from consumer reviews, exhibiting astounding accuracy in projecting concerns across various dimensions of clothing quality. NLP’s potential lies in endowing companies with insights into consumer review, augmented by the BERTopic to facilitate immersive exploration of harvested review topics. This research presents a thorough case for integrating machine learning to foster sustainability and waste reduction. The contribution of this research is notable for its integration of RoBERTa and BERTopic in multilabel classification tasks and topic modeling in the fashion industry. The results indicate that the RoBERTa model exhibits remarkable performance, as demonstrated by its macro-averaged F1 score of 0.87 and micro-averaged F1 score of 0.87. Likewise, BERTopic achieves a coherence score of 0.67, meaning the model can form an insightful topic. © 2023 by the authors."

Additionally, the study aims to gain valuable insights into the readiness of selected local governments in Indonesia by using the established assessment model. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a mixed-method approach, using focus group discussions (FGDs), surveys and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to establish the assessment model. The FGDs involve gathering perspectives on readiness variables from experts in academia, government and practice, whereas the survey collects data from a sample of selected local governments using a questionnaire developed based on the variables obtained in FGDs. The EFA is used on survey data to condense the variables into a smaller set of dimensions or factors. Ultimately, the assessment model is applied to evaluate the level of big data readiness among the selected Indonesian local governments. Findings: FGDs identify 32 essential variables for evaluating the readiness of local governments to adopt big data. Subsequently, EFA reduces this number by five and organizes the remaining variables into four factors: big data strategy, policy and collaboration, infrastructure and human resources and data collection and utilization. The application of the assessment model reveals that the overall readiness for big data in the selected local governments is primarily moderate, with those in the Java cluster displaying higher readiness. In addition, the data collection and utilization factor achieves the highest score among the four factors. Originality/value: This study offers an assessment model for evaluating big data readiness within local governments by combining perspectives from big data experts in academia, government and practice. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The aim of this paper is to analyze the influence of service orientation and airport service quality on airport image through passenger satisfaction as an intervention variable. Methods: The survey was conducted on 356 passengers at the departure area and lounge. Samples were taken at five major airports in Indonesia, including Soekarno Hatta International Airport. To test the influence of exogenous variables on endogenous variables through intervening variables, a quantitative testing analysis test was carried out using the structural equation model partial least square (SEM-PLS). Result: The research results show that service orientation has a significant and positive effect on airport service quality, passenger satisfaction, and airport image. Moreover, service quality also has a positive effect on passenger satisfaction and the airport’s image. Empirically, passenger satisfaction has been proven to mediate the influence of service quality and service orientation on airport image. It has been proven that airport operators who focus on passengers through service orientation can increase passenger satisfaction and the airport’s image. Conclusions: Focusing on passengers’ needs while at the airport is an important aspect for airport operators who aim to manage their emotions, which encourages passengers to use paid services while in the waiting room. The use of this paid service will directly increase the airport’s aeronautical revenue. Future research needs to consider the influence of image on purchase intention and return to the airport. © 2023 by the authors."

We investigated the response of the tropical storm to the model regarding the track and intensity using a modified Kyklop method that appears more appropriate for a landfall cyclone. Our study suggests that the regional climate data computed by the model deviates from the storm track of the global climate data forcing field. In this study, the track of the simulated storm is parallel to the satellite data, but it is shifted slightly to the east, closer to the mainland.

The vertical profiles of pressure, temperature, relative humidity, and wind in the presence of the AUM and MRG waves were obtained and analyzed. The Global Navigation Satellite System - Radio Occultation (GNSS-RO) and the latest ECMWF climate reanalysis (ERA5) data were used to identify the MRG waves features using Hovmöller, space-time spectral, and wavelet analyses. Furthermore, spatial and time-series analyses were performed to study the wave propagation. The results showed the characteristics of atmospheric variables over Pameungpeuk Station in the presence of the AUM and MRG waves. We found that the presence of AUM significantly reduced the relative humidity, particularly in the region from 2 to 10 km altitude, and enhanced the average wind speed during the campaign compared to the wet season. Moreover, we found the reduction of low-level pressure, the enhancement of temperature and relative humidity in the mid-troposphere, and the weakening of the easterly and southerly winds during the dry phase approaching the wet phase of the MRG waves over the southern coast of West Java following the wave structure and propagation. © 2023 The Authors"

To achieve this objective, the quantitative research method was used, and the population in this research is 165 Islamic rural banks in Indonesia, while the sample used in this research is 30 Islamic rural banks in the West Java region from 2016 to 2021. The data used in this study is secondary data derived from financial statements and annual reports and analyzed using Partial Least Square (PLS). The research findings highlighted first that digital transformation significantly influences sustainable business. Second, digital transformation significantly influences corporate governance, and third, digital transformation significantly influences financial performance. Fourth, corporate governance has an insignificant influence on sustainable business for Islamic rural banks in Indonesia. Fifth, financial performance significantly influences sustainable business for Islamic rural banks in Indonesia. Sixth, corporate governance does not mediate the effect of digital transformation on sustainable business for Islamic rural banks in Indonesia. Seventh, financial performance is able to mediate the effect of digital transformation on sustainable business for Islamic rural banks in Indonesia. The practical contribution of this study offers empirical evidence for Islamic rural institutions regarding the impact of digital transformation on the sustainability of Islamic rural banks in the context of the dynamic digital economy and technological industry. While the topic of banks’ digital transformation has garnered significant attention, the focus has primarily been on a macro level. The findings of this study show top management that digital transformation can potentially serve as a form of market value management. Additionally, this research might serve as a valuable resource for digital transformation organizations seeking to enhance their sustainability initiatives and expedite their progress in the realm of sustainable business practices, particularly for Islamic rural banks in Indonesia. Furthermore, the present study has demonstrated the importance and potential for digital transformation within the Islamic banking sector, hence offering a promising avenue for Islamic rural banks to enhance their operational efficiency and client satisfaction. Considering that limited attention has been given to studies of the relationship between digital transformation and sustainable business in Indonesian Islamic rural banks, this study contributes to the existing literature by examining digital transformation as a new view in explaining and understanding Indonesian Islamic rural banks, which fills the gap because prior research on the topic of digital transformation in Indonesia’s Islamic banking sector has mostly ignored management viewpoints on internal corporate governance processes. © 2024 The Author(s).

Our deepfake detection system utilized spatiotemporal feature that extracted using Video Vision Transformer (ViViT). The main contribution of our research is providing a deepfake detection system that based on ViViT architecture and using landmark area images for the input of the system. Our system extracted the feature from a number of spatial features. The spatial feature was extracted using Depthwise Separable Convolution (DSC) block combined with Convolution Block Attention Module (CBAM) from tubelet. The tubelet was a representation of facial landmark area that was extracted from the input video. In our system, we used 25 facial landmark area for an input video. In our experiment we used Celeb-DF version 2 dataset because it is considered to be a challenging deepfake dataset. We conducted augmentation to the dataset, so we obtained 8335 videos for training set, 390 videos for validation set, and 1123 videos for testing set. We trained our deepfake detection system using Adam optimizer, with learning rate of 10-4 and 100 epoch. From the experiment, we obtained the accuracy score of 87.18% and F1 score of 92.52%. We also conducted the ablation study to display the effect of each part of our model to the overall system performance.

This study examined the effect of polarization loss on SISO, SIMO, and MISO channels. This aims to determine how much influence it has on system performance, especially receiving power and channel capacity. Based on the results of measurements and simulations, it was found that the mismatch between the polarization of the incident wave and the polarization of the receiving antenna causes a decrease in the system’s receiving power and channel capacity. When a polarization loss occurs, the received power decreases by approximately 25.14 dBm for linear polarization and 12.69 dBm for circular polarization, and it also reduces channel capacity. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

Manifestations of such leaks are often detected through diminished water pressure, yet the monitoring systems employed by these providers remain suboptimal. Traditional methodologies for identifying and inspecting distribution issues rely heavily on manual, analog procedures. This study seeks to harness the Internet of Things (IoT) for the development of an enhanced water distribution monitoring system. Employing a quantitative experimental methodology, the proposed system integrates an Arduino Uno microcontroller with sensors for water pressure, flow, and GPS location. Data captured by these sensors is synchronized with the Thinger.io platform via an ESP-32 module, facilitating real-time monitoring. Upon evaluation, it was observed that IoT implementation via Thinger.io could effectively track fluctuations in water discharge and pressure. Recorded data revealed a maximum water discharge of 303 liters, with water pressure values ranging from a low of 0.30 bar to a high of 4.07 bar. The outcome of this research is a visual monitoring framework that provides a dynamic assessment of water discharge and pressure, enabling water service providers to conduct routine evaluations with enhanced precision. This IoT-based approach not only streamlines the monitoring process but also introduces a level of automation that could significantly improve service reliability for drinking water infrastructures.  © 2023 IIETA."

Because of its non-contact nature, using radar to detect vital signs such as the rate of respiration from human subjects faces many challenges due to electromagnetic interference, clutter, and random motion disturbance. This research designed a non-contact human respiratory monitoring using radar Xethru X4M03 which is suitable for people who do exercise without physical contact. The proposed system can detect human's respiration that has other signal interferences due to body movements and clutter using the Bandpass Filter method, the system will pass the respiratory frequency and reduce the frequency of other than breathing. We validated the proposed system using Xethru X4M03 that is connected to a series of computer simulations and we also categorized the target in many positions i.e., sleeping position, slightly holding breath, minor body movements, and exercise. The result shows that before filtering it has an error of 1.2 and after filtering it becomes 0.9. In the state of breathing accompanied by holding your breath, the error value generated before filtering is 45.02 and after filtering is 15.99.

By default, Kubernetes only monitors built-in resource metrics such as CPU and memory usage for each host machine and pod. To use Custom Metrics, external software such as Prometheus can be employed to monitor metrics as needed.

As train speeds increase, the Doppler shift occurs and the Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) in the system also increases, which is a common challenge in modulation schemes such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). The paper investigates the impact of HST environments on the performance of Digital Video Broadcasting – Terrestrial (DVB-Terrestrial) systems.

The study includes a comprehensive analysis of the HST channel and its integration with the DVB-Terrestrial system. Key findings demonstrate how higher speeds result in increased PAPR values and changes in the 64-QAM constellation diagram, indicating the necessity for robust power amplifiers and efficient symbol detection methods. The paper also shows that while higher HST speeds generally lead to worse BER values, the performance of channel coding can mitigate this effect to some extent.

The parameters mentioned above are critical for assessing the air quality conditions and concentration of air pollutants. Outdoor air pollution concentration variations before and after the Emergency CARE, which was held in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic on July 3-21, 2021, were studied. An air quality monitoring system based on the IoT generates sensor data that is collected from a government-integrated data portal, and that can be analyzed statistically. There are two main types of ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): one-way (or unidirectional) and two-way, which are applied to the collected sensor data and hypotheses calculated using ANOVA. ANOVA one-way was found to be more effective for analyzing air quality condition data. During emergency CARE, the average concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, and O3 from the air quality monitoring system show values that have exceeded the standard Air Quality Index (AQI), while the concentrations of CO, NO2, and SO2 are still below the applicable AQI values. It stated that air pollution in Jakarta worsened during the implementation of Emergency CARE. © 2024 University of Baghdad-College of Science. All rights reserved."

However, the marketing process of smallholder maize in Indonesia has yet to reach an optimal level of efficiency. This research endeavors to delve into the vertical integration of smallholder maize in the Indonesian agricultural sector.To conduct this analysis, we employ a forward-looking predictive model, applying the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to analyze time series data related to smallholder maize in Indonesia. Our findings yield critical insights that shed light on the intricate dynamics of smallholder maize markets in the archipelago.Notably, our research underscores the long-term integration between producer-level smallholder maize markets and consumer-level smallholder maize markets in Indonesia. This integration implies that changes in producer-level smallholder maize prices are intrinsically linked to shifts in consumer-level smallholder maize prices in the country.

Despite their growing importance, the specifics of their activities in value creation, especially in orchestrating and managing network collaborations for companies and startups, are still poorly understood. This study attempts to fill this knowledge gap by describing a set of orchestration activities that shape the synergy between companies and startups in an accelerator program and correlating these activities with value creation. Empirical evidence was collected through a qualitative case study of a corporate accelerator program. The results show that orchestration activities inherent in the accelerator's network are critical to driving value creation. We identified five such orchestration activities: 1) knowledge mobility and innovation sustainability, which leads to novelty; 2) innovation appropriability and 3) network stability for lock-in, keeping members in the network and increasing relationship quality; 4) innovation coherence as a source of complementarity; and 5) leveraging resources for efficiency. Additionally, our research shows that value for startups begins with expanding their network reach, which encourages the development of new skills, the introduction of novel concepts, and the expansion of existing knowledge. The findings from this study contribute to the theoretical discourse on the importance of network orchestration in the context of corporate accelerators.

One technology that can be applied to the military shooting sector is the Virtual Reality (VR) shooting game. This technology is a shooting training simulator for Military Personnel. This study compares the shooting performance of military personnel in both real and virtual environments. The researchers analyzed the learning curve of the shooting performance, measured the degree of reality, immersive level, and usability of the VR shooting games, and tested the potential application of the simulator. The result showed that the shooting accuracy and precision in real and virtual shooting conditions do not significantly differ. This means that using a VR shooting game simulator can represent the training conditions in the actual shooting range. The shooting speed in virtual environments is related to the stages of the shooter (position, breath control, aiming, and trigger control), which are influenced by human performance factors (shock, vibration, and gun explosions). In addition, the shooting performance when practicing virtual shooting increased significantly, proving a learning curve for adapting to virtual environments in the simulator. VR shooting games had a total SUS score of 81.1, categorized as Grade A usability or excellent usability. Based on the results of the Pearson correlation test, there is a strong positive relationship between the SUS questionnaire and Presence Questionnaire (0.908), SUS and Immersive Tendencies Questionnaire (0.802), and Presence Questionnaire and Immersive Tendencies Questionnaire (0.814). Good usability in VR shooting games positively influences the degree of reality and can make participants feel a high presence when shooting virtually. Thus, VR shooting games are appropriate to support military shooting training for military personnel. © (2024), (Faculty of Engineering). All Rights Reserved."

One model that is widely used as a model to understand the dynamics of cooperation is the replicator equation. While research has been proposed to adapt that equation to a structured graph, we offer a straightforward approach by benefiting from the networked SI diffusion model and replicator equation to create a replicator equation on a network with state-dependent diffusive constant.

Meanwhile, there is still no ideal metaheuristic that can solve all problems superiorly, as declared in the no-free-lunch (NFL) theory. This work introduces a novel swarm-based metaheuristic named as migration-crossover algorithm (MCA). In MCA, the swarm intelligence is enriched with the crossover technique and the neighbourhood search with unbalanced local search space. The global finest solution becomes the reference in the first step while the middle between two stochastically chosen solutions becomes the reference in the second step. The neighbourhood search is performed in the third step. The collection of 23 functions become the use case during the evaluation of MCA. In the first evaluation, MCA is compared with five new metaheuristics: total interaction algorithm (TIA), osprey optimization algorithm (OOA), migration algorithm (MA), coati optimization algorithm (COA), and walrus optimization algorithm (WaOA). The result reveals that MCA is finer than TIA, OOA, MA, COA, and WaOA in 20, 19, 17, 20, and 17 functions subsequently.

However, upon closer examination of existing studies, it becomes evident that many have not fully utilized bibliometric analysis tools and software for comprehensive literature reviews. Therefore, this study aims to explore the essential characteristics, trends, and prevailing themes in the field of missing data imputation.

Regarding to this issue, this paper introduces a novel metaheuristic called swarm space hopping algorithm (SSHA). SSHA consists of three searches. First, a directed search toward the highest quality is performed. Second, the directed search toward the resultant of better agents or away from the other agent is performed. Third, the arithmetic crossover between the agent and a randomized solution in the first half or second half of space is performed. In this work, three evaluations are performed to assess the performance of SSHA. The first evaluation is the benchmark evaluation to compare the performance of SSHA with other recent metaheuristics: northern goshawk optimization (NGO), zebra optimization algorithm (ZOA), clouded leopard optimization (CLO), osprey optimization algorithm (OOA), and total interaction algorithm (TIA).

This disorder affects children's development, making it difficult for nerve function to develop, and causes the child concerned to have difficulty in fostering social relationships. Early detection of children with ASD is needed so that treatment is fast and on target. Currently, facilities and research on early diagnosis of ASD patients through EEG signals are still very few, requiring much cost and more effort to analyze EEG signals in examinations related to ASD detection cases. This study proposes a mobile phone application that can distinguish people living with ASD and normal data signals based on asynchronous EEG brain signals. This research also produces a preprocessing algorithm and BCI2000 EEG data signal so that it can be automated using Python. This research also produces an output model, namely the Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network, which is deployed using Python-Flask so that the diagnosis of EEG signals with ASD and normal patients can be used on various platforms through restAPI. This research is also expected to help the community and support the diagnosis of ASD sufferers so that they can be handled appropriately. Data for ASD sufferers and normal data were correctly classified into the appropriate class. Handling this disease requires close and integrated cooperation, so this ASD classification will be very helpful for patients and can make a diagnosis in a faster time, enabling patients to receive targeted treatment and therapy. © IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License."

Mobile anchors can be an efficient solution for the number of anchors in a 3-dimensional environment requiring more local anchors. The reliability of a localization system using mobile anchors is determined by various parameters such as energy efficiency, coverage, computational complexity, and cost. Various methods have been proposed by researchers to build a reliable mobile anchor localization system. This certainly shows the many research opportunities that can be carried out in mobile anchor localization. The many opportunities in this topic will be very confusing for researchers who want to research in this field in choosing a topic area early. However, until now there is still no paper that discusses systematic mapping studies that can provide information on topic areas and trends in the field of mobile anchor localization. A systematic Mapping Study (SMS) was conducted to determine the topic area and its trends, influential authors, and produce modeling topics and trends from the resulting modeling topics. This SMS can be a solution for researchers who are interested in research in the field of mobile anchor localization in determining the research topics they are interested in for further research. This paper gives information on the mobile anchor research area, the author who has influenced mobile anchor localization research, and the topic modeling and trend that potentially promissing research in the future. The SMS includes a chronology of publications from 2017-2022, bibliometric co-occurrence, co-author analysis, topic modeling, and trends. The results show that the development of mobile anchor localization publications is still developing until 2022. There are 10 topic models with 6 of them included in the promising topic.

Many people do not realize that garbage can be a source of disease, environmental pollution and other negative things. Most people still often throw garbage carelessly. The local government has placed garbage bins in public spaces but people sometimes still throw out the garbage that doesnot fit the type. Disposing of garbage in the same place is considered to be difficult for garbage menagement because each type of garbage has a different time to decompose. It is necessary to classify garbage based on its basic ingredients so that garbage management becomes better and easier. Organic garbage can be used for fertilizer while non-organic garbage can be recycled. This research proposes to build a classifier that is able to distinguish the types of garbage. Transfer learning approach based on Convolutional Neural Network architecture is implemented in this research. Two pre-trained models are implemented-VGG16 and MobileNet, to train thousands of images from 12 types of garbage which are Battery, Biological, Brown-Glass, Cardboard, Clothes, Green-Glass, Metal, Paper, Plastic, Shoes, Trash and White-Glass. Based on the experimental results, the accuracy of the VGG16 architecture reaches 86% and the accuracy of the MobileNet architecture reaches 85%. © 2023 Author(s)."

The management of electricity supply for industries in Karawang Regency is entrusted to the Indonesian State Electricity Enterprises, also known as PLN. However, there are still disturbances in the distribution system that affect industrial customers. The primary causes of these disturbances are 39% jointing damage, 36% damage caused by third parties, and 15% damage to cubicles. The occurrence of these disturbances is closely tied to maintenance activities on the electric power distribution system. To assess the distribution system's reliability, various indices are calculated, including the System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), energy not supplied (ENS), and feeder disturbance indices. Currently, PT PLN (Persero) UP3 Karawang employs a maintenance model that combines corrective and preventive methods with the four-discipline execution (4DX) approach. This study aims to develop an improved maintenance model that enhances the overall performance of the electric power distribution system for industrial customers. In this study, a maintenance model is proposed by integrating the total productive maintenance (TPM) method, reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) method, and four-discipline execution (4DX) approach. The developed maintenance model is tested on 40 feeders serving industrial customers. A comparative analysis is performed before and after implementing the maintenance model, considering the SAIFI, SAIDI, ENS, feeder disturbance, and overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) indexes. The analysis of the 40 feeders reveals improvements in performance following the implementation of the maintenance model using the TPM, RCM, and 4DX methods. Prior to implementation, the SAIFI was 0.24 times/cust.yr, SAIDI was 1.877 min/cust.yr, ENS was 60,470 kWh, feeder disturbance occurred 8 times, and OEE was 0.99935. After implementation, the SAIFI improved to 0.016 times/cust.yr, SAIDI reduced to 1.342 min/cust.yr, ENS decreased to 41,241 kWh, feeder disturbance reduced to 4 times, and OEE increased to 0.99962. Consequently, the performance improvements are as follows: SAIFI by 33%, SAIDI by 29%, ENS by 32%, feeder interference by 50%, and OEE by 0.027%. © 2023 The Authors"

As an example, Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is an attack where the attacker aims to gain network access while remaining undetected for an extended period. In this study, therefore, we aim to investigate APT in network traffic by applying a statistical analysis approach. Five relevant network parameters were identified as APT indications. The parameters are source Internet Protocol (IP) address, destination IP address, protocols, destination ports, and volume of the packets. Subsequently, we examined the parameters using a descriptive statistic approach. Correlation testing between the parameters was undertaken using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient test with 20 hypotheses. Our findings showed that many incoming and outgoing packets between the same two IP addresses, port number 80 and TCP protocol were used, and there were patterns of sending the same volume of packets. Correlation findings indicate that Source IP address, Destination IP address, and Volume can be referred to as independent variables, while Destination port and Protocol can be referred to as dependent variables. The significance of this study is for future work, for example in evaluating dependent and independent indicators that can be applied to create APT detection tools. © 2023 Author(s)."

However, manual interpretation can be time consuming and subject to human error. Automatic segmentation of echocardiogram can support cardiologists in making an initial interpretation. However, such a process does not always provide straightforward information to make a complete interpretation. The segmentation process only identifies the region of cardiac septal abnormality, whereas complete interpretation should determine based on the position of defect. In this study, we proposed a stacked residual-dense network model to segment the entire region of cardiac and classifying their defect positions to generate automatic echocardiographic interpretation. We proposed the generalization model with incorporated two modalities: prenatal and postnatal echocardiography. To further evaluate the effectiveness of our model, its performance was verified by five cardiologists. We develop a pipeline process using 1345 echocardiograms for training data and 181 echocardiograms for unseen data from prospective patients acquired during standard clinical practice at Muhammad Hoesin General Hospital in Indonesia. As a result, the proposed model produced of 58.17% intersection over union (IoU), 75.75% dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and 76.36% mean average precision (mAP) for the validation data. Using unseen data, we achieved 42.39% IoU, 55.72% DSC, and 51.04% mAP. Further, the classification of defect positions using unseen data had approximately 92.27% accuracy, 94.33% specificity, and 92.05% sensitivity. Finally, our proposed model is validated with human expert with varying Kappa value.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic reduced the world economy and caused economic shocks in various business sectors. Women successors face significant challenges in overcoming family business problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in terms of resilience, which is seen as the organization's prominent ability for sustainability in a turbulent environment. Thus, this study aims to explore women's initiatives and propose a framework for family business resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a qualitative method with a case study approach to explore women's initiatives in family business resilience during the COVID-19 period. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with five women's successors of family businesses in Indonesia. Triangulation was used to test data validity. Meanwhile, data analysis uses the Miles–Huberman technique: data reduction, data display and conclusion drawing/verification. Findings: This study found that women have the initiative to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic to develop and implement resilience in the family business. This study proposes a framework for factors that enhance family business resilience, including strategic decision-making (adaptive capacity, strategy renewal and appropriation capacity), strategic factors (successor motivation, successor competence and family support) and successor incremental program. Women have a long-term orientation toward the sustainability of their family businesses and can overcome various conflicts. The stereotypical view of women's leadership in family businesses has experienced a shift in which capability and competence are the main factors in recognizing women's leadership. Originality/value: This study contributes to understanding women's roles in the resilience of family businesses under extreme stress during the pandemic. This study proposes a framework for family business resilience. In addition, this study adds new insights into the specific context of managing family business systems during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the resource-based view (RBV) and strategic management approach. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The data used in this study were the CENS and MJO indices, Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), convective inhibition (CINH), Vertically Integrated Moisture Flux Convergence (VIMFC), and rainfall from atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate (ERA-5) for 18 years (2001–2018). The average diurnal profiles of CAPE, CINH, VIMFC, and rainfall over five different locations (mountain, coastal land, coast, coastal sea, non-coastal sea) were plotted to see their patterns under five different large-scale conditions: CENS, Active MJO (AMJO), CENS + Active MJO (CAMJO), CENS + Inactive MJO (CIMJO), and the mean condition. The results showed a distinctive and regular character of diurnal profiles of CAPE, CINH, VIMFC, and rainfall in the five locations caused by the specific responses of different underlying surface properties to the diurnal cycle of incoming solar radiation. Furthermore, CENS tended to reduce CAPE (~ 33% reduction, averaged over all locations), which might suppress free (natural) convection. CENS also tended to reduce CINH (~ 41%), which might facilitate convection. Conversely, CENS tended to increase VIMFC significantly (~ 174%), probably through its interaction with the land breezes, which could induce forced convection. As a result, rainfall significantly increased (~ 63%) during CENS. AMJO showed similar effects to CENS but with much weaker influences. On average, AMJO reduced CAPE (~ 14%), slightly reduced CINH (~ 2%), increased VIMFC (~ 28%), and slightly reduced rainfall (~ 3%). However, the effects were the strongest when CENS and AMJO coincided (CAMJO), during which CAPE reduced (~ 37%), CINH reduced (~ 31%), VIMFC increased (~ 334%), and rainfall increased (~ 123%). The effect of CENS and AMJO was strongest over the coastal area, where rainfall increased by ~ 215%. Therefore, one of the most important results from this study was that the increase in rainfall during CENS and AMJO was not caused primarily by the increase of free convection (indicated by the CAPE), which tended to decrease. The increase of rainfall during CENS and AMJO was found mainly due to the increase of moisture convergence (indicated by the VIMFC), which might induce forced convection. We also found that a relatively high value of CINH tended to coincide with a lower value of rainfall, indicating a possible role of CINH in preventing convection. The results of the analysis of the effects of CENS and MJO on the diurnal cycle of CAPE, CINH, and VIMFC have given a better understanding of the detailed mechanisms that produce rainfall increase, which have not been much discussed in previous studies. During CENS/MJO, CAPE decreased, so its role was reducing free convection. CINH also generally decreased, so its role was increasing the potential for convective initiation. VIMFC tended to increase significantly, especially around the coast, so its role was increasing the potential for convection. The role of VIMFC tended to be dominant in increasing rainfall. Conversely, the role of CAPE was less important since it was reduced. The effects of MJO were similar to but weaker than CENS in reducing CAPE, reducing CINH, and increasing VIMFC. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature."

In this paper, we propose developments in the feature extraction and feature selection phases in the driving fatigue detection framework. For feature extraction, we employ heart rate fragmentation to extract non-linear features to analyze the driver’s cognitive status. These features are combined with features obtained from heart rate variability analysis in the time, frequency, and non-linear domains. In feature selection, we employ mutual information to filter redundant features. To find the number of selected features with the best model performance, we carried out 28 combination experiments consisting of 7 possible selected features out of 58 features and 4 ensemble learnings.

One of the well-known techniques used in overcoming privacy issues during analysis is differential privacy. However, many studies have shown that differential privacy decreased the machine learning model performance. It becomes problematic for any organization like the government to draw a policy from accurate insights from citizen statistics while maintaining citizen privacy. This study reviews differential privacy in machine learning algorithms and evaluates its performance on real COVID-19 patient data, using Jakarta, Indonesia as a case study. Besides that, we also validate our study with two additional datasets, the public Adult dataset from University of California, Irvine, and an Indonesia socioeconomic dataset. We find that using differential privacy tends to reduce accuracy and may lead to model failure in imbalanced data, particularly in more complex models such as random forests. The finding emphasizes differential privacy usage in government is practical for the trustworthy government but with distinct challenges. We discuss limitations and recommendations for any organization that works with personal data to leverage differential privacy in the future. © 2023 ACM."

In parallel, cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) is a commonly used ovarian tumor marker. This study aimed to compare the roles of GLS and CA-125 in distinguishing between benign and malignant ovarian tumors. The research was conducted as a comparative study, enrolling 156 patients with ovarian tumors. Preoperative serum CA-125 and GLS levels were analyzed to evaluate their effectiveness in distinguishing between benign and malignant ovarian tumors. The results revealed that the mean levels of CA-125 and GLS were significantly higher in malignant ovarian tumors compared with benign ones (389.54 ± 494.320 vs. 193.15 ± 529.932 (U/mL) and 17.37 ± 12.156 vs. 7.48 ± 4.095 (μg/mL), respectively). The CA-125 and GLS cutoff points of 108.2 U/mL and 18.32 μg/mL, respectively, were associated with malignant ovarian tumors. Multivariate analyses showed that GLS had higher predictive capabilities compared with CA-125 (odds ratio 9.4 vs. 2.1). The accuracy of using GLS combined with CA-125 was higher than using CA-125 alone (73.1% vs. 68.8%). In conclusion, higher levels of CA-125 and GLS are associated with malignant ovarian tumors. GLS outperforms CA-125 in distinguishing between benign and malignant ovarian tumors. The combination of GLS and CA-125 demonstrated improved accuracy for distinguishing benign and malignant ovarian tumors when compared with using CA-125 alone. © 2023 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses binomial logistic regression modeling on two data sets: a nationwide survey at the individual level of 8,854 usable samples conducted in 2019 and village potential statistics. Findings: The survey indicates low adoption and use of e-government services among both males and females. The statistical analysis further reveals that although there might be some variations in the influencing factors between the genders, the overall patterns are similar. These findings suggest that the low adoption and use of e-government services among males and females can be attributed to factors such as misperceptions about internet-based services, resulting in low motivation to use the services, inadequate internet connectivity, affordability, limited digital skills and exposure to harmful online content.

This paper proposes a new quantum coding scheme in the class of Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes based on the Reed-Muller codes, since Reed-Muller codes are one of provably classical Shannon Capacity achieving codes. This paper keeps the proposed new codes simple by making dual-containing CSS codes having Hx = Hz, such that no further search is required for Hx or Hz. The proposed quantum Reed-Muller codes are designed from the classical Reed-Muller codes with puncturing to obtain new codes with block-length of n = 7 qubits capable of error correcting t = 1 qubit error and quantum information of k = 1 qubit, of which the extension to other block-lengths are expected to be straightforward. This paper performs a series of computer simulations to evaluate the quantum word error rate (QWER) performances under the depolarizing channels. The proposed quantum Reed-Muller codes satisfy the stabilizer codes requirement, where the diagonal element of symplectic inner product (SIP) is kept zero to guarantee a successful error correction. The proposed codes have a structure with a length close to that of the perfect quantum codes. Our results confirm that the stabilizers of the proposed codes can extract the syndrome and distinguish all error patterns of any single qubit error. This paper also confirm that the simulated performances are agreed by the theoretical QWER performances indicating that the both coding design and simulation environment are correct. These results confirm that the classical Reed-Muller codes can be used directly as QECC by puncturing the parity check matrix H. The results of this paper are expected to open new ground on the invention of new quantum codes derived from the classical codes. © 2023 AIP Publishing LLC."

This also has an impact on the education and learning process that can be online anywhere. Senior High School and Vocational High School are one of the levels of secondary education in Indonesia. Senior High School tends to study more theory and Vocational High School has a larger portion of practice. However, not a few high school graduates enroll in college in the Information Technology major, where students will learn computer programming practices which should be vocational subjects. Currently, applications for the learning needs of high school students to learn basic programming are mostly still paid. The development of the interface design applications for high school students learning basic programming called Conlab is expected to help the students learning programming process. User interface is needed to design a website to look attractive and easy to use. To design and implement the design, the author uses a goal-directed design. Goal-directed design is one method in building Human-Computer Interaction with a focus on user goals. This method has been used to build the prototype. The prototype has met the requirements as the Misson Usability Score and Maze Usability Score shows that the final score is 85 and the method of System Usability Scale performs a final score 76.2 showing that its usability quality is high. © 2023 Author(s)."

However, there are still elderly people who take medication irregularly because their memory is starting to weaken. Early signs experienced by the elderly who suffer from memory skills are forgetting about information that has just been obtained or learned and often having difficulty completing daily work routines, so it is necessary to develop a research on products that help the elderly in carrying out regular drug-taking activities without need help from people to remind them. In this research, the design thinking method was used, namely identifying the wants and needs of 20 elderly people while taking medication and identifying them according to the first stage of design thinking empathy, through interviews and direct observation at the Guido Valadares Hospital in Timor-Leste. After the first stage, the author enters the second stage, which is define to describe the user's view which will be the basis of the product to be made. With the first and second stages already, the author will enter the third stage, namely ideate to describe the required solution. This study aims to describe each stage of design thinking in the design of reminder aids for the elderly in an effort to create appropriate and effective solutions to the problems faced by patients at Guido Valadares Hospital Timor-Leste. This study uses a qualitative approach with descriptive analysis. The result of this study is that with a good design thinking process, this research has resulted in a solution for patients in the hospital by designing an image of a proposed reminder tool that helps patients take medication regularly. The implementation of the design thinking stage that was carried out was not optimal due to material constraints so that it did not reach the prototype and test stages for users, and the author only used three stages of design thinking (empathy, define, and ideate), without reaching the prototype and test stages does not affect the results of the identification using the design thinking method. In designing a reminder tool, it is hoped that it can help patients at the hospital to take medication on time and can check heart rate and oxygen levels in the body when needed, the product is expected to be easy to use so that users can use it easily. Reminder tools can assist users with audible alarm sounds for reminders. The reminder aid product also has a large screen so that users can see the time easily and can see the results of checking heart rate and oxygen levels and the results of subsequent alarms. The reminder aid has a button that can set the next alarm so that it helps the patient easily. Reminder aid products also have additional partitions to divide medication in the morning, noon, or evening. © 2023 Author(s)."

Therefore, risk needs to be managed with risk management plan. The objective of risk management is to recognize risks in a project and develop strategies to reduce or even avoid them, on the other hand to find ways to maximize opportunities. Due to uncover the previous business process, Company X is going to build the new factory to coffee processing. Since the project has not been started, it is recommended to produce risk management plan in earlier stage of project. The process used in this research is identifying risk, performance qualitative risk analysis, and risk response plan, according to PMBOK 6 edition. In this research, WBS is used as input to identify risk which is processed into risk register and thereafter becomes probability and impact matrix. It is necessary to know the response or action that can be done. The result obtained from this research is risk register for coffee plant construction project which earned more than 43 risk. There are only 2 risks which sit on red level (high risk) and 3 risk which sit on orange level (medium risk). The most dangerous risk within this project is Project permit to start the work order has not been issued yet, wrong estimation on project budgeting. The first dangerous risk is triggered by poor stakeholder management plan while the second risk is triggered by poor site survey. The medium risks are commonly triggered by quality issue thus quality metric is suggested as risk response. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved."

We demonstrate that QML circuit can be constructed to solve the problem of demapping involving many points, which is in general difficult and intractable, especially when the number of modulation constellation points are significantly large. In this paper, we use an amplitude encoding technique to map the received signal constellations, followed by data processing prior to the measurement, for further processing. The proposed QML circuit is confirmed to be able to demap successfully the signals of 5G NR, i.e., complex binary phase shift keying (C-BPSK) modulations with the training data of only the four complex symbols.

The engine was operated with the blends of B10, B20, and B30 with 5% graphene nano additives (designated as B10G5, B20G5, and B30G5). To find the parameter's optimum values, the Desirability Function approach (DFA), Swarm Salp single objective, Multi Objective Bat algorithm (MOBA), Response surface methodology (RSM) and D-optimal design approach were employed. Advanced machine learning (ML) techniques were employed to anticipate these characteristics. It was found that B20G5 had a better brake thermal efficiency (BTE), when compared to the other samples (and around 11% higher than diesel fuel at full load). The emissions of Carbon monoxide (CO) and Hydrocarbon (HC) were lower for B20G5 blended fuel than for diesel (Around 23.52% lower than diesel). In comparison to Response surface methodology (RSM), the overall coefficient of determination (R2) value using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for was high. As a result, it was revealed that the ANN was typically better than the RSM in forecasting the various factors affecting the engine performance. The optimum outcomes were achieved by single objective (Salp Swarm algorithm) and multi-objective algorithms. According to multi-objective algorithm, a B20G5 nano additive biodiesel mix at its maximum Brake power (BP) produced the highest value of BTE with the lowest Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions.

However, no specifically developed system can monitor those variables in the field until this study is reported. This research focuses on establishing a hardware system for monitoring the soil's temperature and humidity using an array of sensors for hydrological monitoring. Due to extreme weather and limited data transmission networks, employing monitoring systems in harsh environments presents a significant challenge. This investigation involved the monitoring system in monitoring soil temperature and moisture at Mount Malabar. The system comprises an SHT20 sensor array, a microcomputer serving as the central unit and data recorder, a data transmission module, and cloud-based long-term data storage. SHT20 sensors are a fully calibrated type with a temperature accuracy of 99.99%, while relative humidity accuracy ranges from ±3 to ±5. This research has successfully demonstrated soil temperature and relative humidity measurements at depths ranging from 0 cm to 30 cm below the soil surface with a spacing of 5 cm.

X-Ray is a medical imaging technique often used to detect bone fractures. However, X-Rays can have radiation effects that harm patients, health workers, and the environment. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a system that can obtain object images based on the electrical impedance distribution. In bone fractures, the proximal bone tissue experiences increased blood flow with local edema due to the inflammatory reaction which indicates the presence of a high conductivity diffusion material at the fracture location. EIT based on the STEMlab Red Pitaya module can be utilized to detect bone fractures. Red Pitaya serves as a controller, possessing a voltage generator, an oscilloscope, and 16 input/output pins that fulfill most of the EIT functions. To test the EIT-based system's efficacy, a 3D-printed polylactic acid (PLA)-based bone phantom model was used. This model was placed on a cylindrical phantom filled with water as a substitute for soft tissue. The voltage data then are reconstructed using electrical impedance and diffuse optical reconstruction software (EIDORS), a MATLAB toolbox devoted to image reconstruction from impedance measurement results. The results of the reconstruction demonstrated that EIT based on the Red Pitaya STEMlab module could distinguish between normal bone and fractured bone. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

TiO2-natural zeolite (TiO2-NZ) hybrid composites, as an integrated photocatalysis-adsorption system, have been synthesized using the sol-gel method with varied zeolite masses (1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 g). The photodegradation of Cr(VI) by TiO2-NZ composites was tested, and it was discovered that the sample with a variation of 1.5 g zeolite (TiO2-NZ/1.5) produced the highest Cr(VI) degradation. The combination of natural zeolite adsorption and TiO2 photocatalytic properties has resulted in an increase in the material's photocatalytic ability to degrade Cr(VI). The TiO2-NZ/1.5 sample has the highest Cr(VI) removal rate of up to 97 percent, according to our findings. Crystal changes, morphology, porosity, elemental composition, and optical properties of the composite with superior performance were investigated using XRD, SEM-EDS, the N2-adsorption-desorption isotherm, and UV–vis DRS. TiO2 synthesized by the sol-gel method was in the anatase phase and successfully immobilized on the zeolite surface. The incorporation of TiO2 on the surface of the zeolite has suppressed the crystal size and band gap energy of TiO2. On the other hand, the presence of TiO2 has increased the specific surface area of the zeolite. In general, a larger specific surface area can show better adsorption ability and provide more active sites in photocatalytic reactions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."

However, its application in the context of renewable energy penetration into low-voltage grids remains understudied. This paper addresses this research gap by presenting a refined voltage drop model tailored for the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) distribution network. Based on a derived mathematical equation, the model is validated and analyzed using Simulink's modeling platform. Simulations are performed without and with the VRDT, revealing that renewable energy penetration can cause instability, leading to voltage deviations proportional to the injected renewable energy. Incorporating the VRDT in the low-voltage grid allows for voltage adjustment under loaded conditions, ensuring uninterrupted renewable energy injection. Voltage stability analysis is conducted using actual load consumption data from the IIUM network for 2020 and 2021, offering valuable insights despite assuming equal energy consumption across buildings. Most hostels exhibit stable distribution systems with solar energy, but instability arises when solar energy comprises 100% of the input for the Safiyyah and Zubair hostels' 11kV distribution transformers. Implementing the VRDT regulates this instability, restoring system stability. This study highlights the importance of VRDT integration in high renewable energy proportion low-voltage grids, enabling voltage regulation and stability under variable renewable energy injection scenarios. The findings demonstrate that VRDTs mitigate voltage instability caused by renewable energy, providing a reliable solution for incorporating renewables into low-voltage distribution networks. It contributes to understanding renewable energy's impact on distribution system stability and offers guidance for VRDT implementation in similar contexts. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The caching strategy regulates content distribution by deciding which network nodes are most suited to store duplicates of popular data. Hence, cache placement decisions are crucial to the NDN cache strategy. According to a prior study, caching decisions should consider the availability of cache storage for each node, the network's structure, and the content's popularity. However, all those criteria are not considered simultaneously in the decision-making process. Ignoring critical criteria can lead to destructive and ineffective decisions. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) improves NDN efficiency in caching decisions. This paper introduces C3CPS, a novel caching placement strategy based on MCDM using CoCoSo and CRITIC weighting method for enhanced content distribution. C3CPS considers five criteria, including two related to the network topologies, two related to cache storage, and the popularity of the content. Then, C3CPS examines these criteria with the CRITIC method to determine the weight of each criterion and the CoCoSo method to determine the optimal cache node. The ICARUS simulator validates C3CPS.

Detailed experiments with univariate and multivariate problems were conducted, and the results show that LSTM-ELM and ELM-LSTM have the lowest MAE and RMSE results compared to stand-alone LSTM and ELM for the univariate problem. In addition, LSTM-ELM and ELM-LSTM result in lower computation time compared to stand-alone LSTM.

Studies on combi-natorial optimization problems include the selection of vehicle routes on road traffic, known as the NP-hard problem. We propose a vehicle route problem that can be formulated in the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model as a combina-torial problem to optimize vehicle route selection. The solution aims to optimize the vehicle's journey to reach a destination. The experiment presents a formulation to solve traffic congestion problems on certain roads. The selection of vehicle routes results in optimizing the distribution of alternative road vehicle flows. The level of road density is a cost function that will be optimized, and the constraint is a limitation on the route choice for each vehicle. This vehicle routing problem considers the weight parameter (as distance in actual road conditions) of the road segment that affects the cost function. The simulations on the D-Wave quantum annealer show optimal results on the route deployment of several vehicles. The cost value on route choice with weighted segments gives better results than in previous studies. Each vehicle can go through different road options and accurately reduce road conges-tion. This solution provides an opportunity to develop QUBO modeling on more complex vehicle routing problems to reduce road congestion. © 2023 Author(s)."

This result is consistent with previous work done by Otsuka et al. (2006), who have analyzed scintillation and zonal drift velocity data obtained at Kototabang in 2003–2004, and suggests that the eastward drift velocity corresponding to the downward electric field at post-sunset may be related to the pre-reversal enhancement of eastward electric field, which could play an important role in generating plasma bubble. In this study, we have investigated vertical drift velocity by analyzing the ionosonde data obtained near magnetic equator (Chumphon, Bac Lieu, and Cebu) during a period from 2003 to 2016, and found that the upward drift velocity at post-sunset is larger in Mar. equinox than Sep. equinox. We also find that solar activity dependence of the zonal and vertical drift velocities is more clearly seen in Mar. equinox than in Sep. equinox. In order to consider the mechanism causing the equinoctial asymmetry of the drift velocities, foF2 obtained by the ionosondes is also analyzed. We find that foF2 also depends on solar activity more clearly in Mar. equinox than in Sep. equinox, and that foF2 during high solar activity conditions is higher in Mar. equinox than in Sep. equinox. These results suggest that in Mar. equinox, due to high electron density, intense electric field could be generated through the F-region dynamo so that plasma bubble likely occurs. © 2023"

Design/methodology/approach: This study used a quantitative method with a survey approach by distributing questionnaires to 206 SMEs in Indonesia that have implemented internationalization practices. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to predict and estimate relationships. Findings: This study finds that one of the SMEs’ strategies to encounter the new normal era of COVID-19 is to improve their internationalization performance, especially by actively participating in international markets. The empirical results show that organizational dynamic capabilities and organizational culture are proven to fully mediate the relationship between international entrepreneurial orientation and the internationalization performance of SMEs.

We investigated the spatial and vertical structure of precipitating cloud systems and the plausible mechanism triggering the two case studies with combined multiple remote sensing observations using an X-band polarimetric Doppler Weather Radar (Xpol) and X-band rain scanner radar (RSR) network, supported by rain gauges and satellite observation. The local processes controlling the intense rainfall events over the complex topography were quantified for the first time using an observational campaign in Indonesia. During the first EP event (23–25 March 2021), the modified satellite algorithm successively confirmed that the mesoscale convective system triggered the local anomalous circulation. The RSR network reveals that the EP in eastern GB contributed to the overflow of the Citarum River alongside the basin, coinciding with the eastward propagating convective system that produced oblate-shaped water droplets without hail. Nevertheless, during the second EP event on 11 April 2021, the strengthening of mountain-based convection played a main role in producing RHM, confirmed by a hail differential reflectivity larger than 12 dB and exhibited hail early stage over two height levels in different locations (981 m and 1033 m) in the GB.

It is important for each student to know their respective learning styles so that in the learning process can understand the material to the fullest. One way to find out the type of student learning style is with VARK modalities (Visual, Auditory, Read/Write, and Kinaesthetic). The VARK model classifies learning style types into four types. Everyone must have all four types of learning styles, but there must be one of the most dominant.

However, this model performs well under strict assumptions such as the number of observations, the linearity of variables, multicollinearity, homoskedasticity, reliability of measurement, and normality. Besides, there is no consideration to date for handling and cleansing inconsistent samples in the data sets. These samples may significantly influence the performance of multiple linear regression in terms of these assumptions and several aspects, such as adjusted R-square, intercept-slopes, exogenous variables, and the accuracy of prediction. In this paper, the data reduction strategy of rough sets was employed to remove and clean these types of samples, boosting the performance of the linear regression models. This strategy was evaluated by examining three different effects; adjusted R-square, slopes-intercepts, and mean square error of the regression model. Simulated data and simple modeling problems were used to determine the effects of these three aspects. The secondary data sets were collected from various domains to examine the proposed rough-regression model. The simulation results showed that the data reduction strategy is exceedingly effective to boost the performance of the multiple linear regression in the three aspects above. In the implementation, these aspects also performed better than before data reduction. The results from both simulations and implementations demonstrate that the data reduction of rough sets is a viable strategy in cleansing of the inconsistent samples in the linear regression models. Thus, the proposed rough regression model is effectively proven to support the data analysis of surveys or cross-sectional studies, especially when the stated aspects are not well fulfilled. Therefore, the surveys are not needed to be repeated and reconsidered by researchers. © 2022"

Voids possess micrometer size and various shapes, which requires a micrometer resolution technique for identification. This study aims to identify, classify, and count the number of voids in resin-covered fiberglass composite digital images, as well as to correlate the voids with the composite tensile strength. For that purpose, we applied the template matching method in digital image processing combining with the normalized cross-correlation (NCC) method to analyze the digital images of the composites prepared by dry-, wet-, and rolled-lay-up methods. We observed various shapes and sizes of voids present in the composite surface and correlated them with the composite tensile strength. Even t hough the samples are prepared with the same fabrication processes, the number of voids on each sample are varied. However, only voids with a diameter size larger than 70μm were found to influence the tensile strength strongly. The composite tensile strength tends to decrease with the increase of large voids numbers, whereas no consistent relation is observed between the number of small voids and tensile strength. We also found that RGB image templates are more accurate for localized void identification with a strong contrast with its surrounding. This study reveals the potential of digital image processing methods for identifying and characterizing various void geometries in composites.  © 2023 Author(s)."

The annealing heat treatments had (i) a small influence on the corrosion rate of both WE43 and Zn7Ag wires, (ii) little influence on the mechanical properties of WE43, and (iii) had little influence on the strength of Zn7Ag but tended to decrease ductility and eliminated strain softening.

It can trigger seizures without any stimuli. An accurate diagnosis of epilepsy is essential to the treatment and management of the patient's condition. Electroencephalography EEG is a non-invasive technique for the diagnosis of epilepsy. Data analysis and processing can be challenging due to the high dimensionality of EEG signals. In this study, the dimensionality reduction technique using compressive sensing is applied to EEG signals to optimize the process and improve the accuracy of the classification in the epileptic EEG signals. The CS method is applied to minimize processed data by reducing EEG signal dimensions, and energy is calculated on the compressed signal as a feature. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using SVM with Linear, Quadratic, Cubic, and Radian Basis Function kernels through 5- and 10-fold cross-validation. The results showed 100% accuracy in the classification of ictal and inter-ictal EEG signals with compression ratios of 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8.

The current method for RNA aptamer identification in vitro uses the SELEX method, which is considered inefficient due to its complex process. Computational models of aptamers have been used to predict and study the molecular interaction of modified aptamers to improve affinity. In this study, we generated three-dimensional models of five RNA aptamers from their sequence using mFold, RNAComposer web server, and molecular dynamics simulation. The model structures were then evaluated and compared with the experimentally determined structures. This study showed that the combination of mFold, RNAComposer, and molecular dynamics simulation could generate 14-16, 28, or 29 nucleotides length of 3D RNA aptamer with similar geometry and topology to the experimentally determined structures. The non-canonical basepair structure of the aptamer loop was formed through the MD simulation, which also improved the three-dimensional RNA aptamers model.

In this study, dataset from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system was used as the sole input for the machine learning models. To forecast blood glucose levels 15, 30, and 45 minutes in the future, we suggested deep neural network (DNN) and tested it on 7 patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The suggested prediction model was evaluated against a variety of machine learning models, such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), decision tree (DT), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), random forest (RF), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The experimental findings demonstrated that the proposed DNN model outperformed all other models, with average root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 17.295, 25.940, and 35.146 mg/dL over prediction horizons (PHs) of 15, 30, and 45 minutes, respectively. Additionally, we have included the suggested prediction model in web-based blood glucose level prediction tools.

In general, WS estimation at different heights requires the site-dependent parameters such as wind shear coefficient, atmospheric conditions, and roughness length. This paper examines the use of the Convolutional Neural Networks and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-BLSTM) to estimate WS at different heights based on measurements at lower heights. To perform vertical extrapolation, the CNN-BLSTM uses measured WS at 10–40 m heights to predict WS at 50 m. The predicted WS at 50 m are further used along with the measured WS at 10–40 to extrapolate WS at 60 m. This procedure is repeated until the extrapolation of WS at 180 m is achieved. The performance of the CNN-BLSTM is compared with the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine for regression (SVM), and the standard wind shear exponent (WSE)-based estimation. The extrapolated values obtained using these methods are compared with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) reference system-based measurements. The coefficient of determination (R2) between extrapolated and actual WS values at height 180 m corresponding to CNN-BLSTM, MLP, SVM, and WSE methods are found to be 69.13%, 64.75%, 61.96%, and 55.96%, respectively. © 2023, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals."

However, women continue encountering numerous difficulties when engaging in entrepreneurial activities, particularly from a societal perspective. Therefore, it is necessary to study the underlying factors influencing women's entrepreneurial intentions that lead to their success in entrepreneurship. This study examines gender stereotype perceptions, perceived social support and self-efficacy in women's entrepreneurial intentions in Batik micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in West Java, Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a quantitative method by randomly distributing questionnaires to women entrepreneurs in the MSME sector in the batik craft industry in the Trusmi area, West Java, Indonesia. The research questionnaire was completed by 150 female entrepreneurs, and a structural equation model-partial least squares (PLS) was employed to examine the hypotheses proposed in this study. Findings: The findings of this study revealed that gender stereotype perception and perceived social support have a positive and significant effect on self-efficacy. Gender stereotype perceptions affect women's entrepreneurial intentions, both directly and mediated by self-efficacy. Meanwhile, perceived social support has a significant effect on women's entrepreneurial intention only when it is mediated by self-efficacy. Originality/value: This study presents empirical evidence on how gender stereotype perception, perceived social support and self-efficacy affect women's entrepreneurial intentions and establishes a novel conceptual framework for women's entrepreneurship in emerging economies.

However, vehicular NDN (VNDN) faces numerous challenges, including security, privacy, routing, and caching. Specifically, the attackers can jeopardize vehicles’ cache memory with a Content Poisoning Attack (CPA). The CPA is the most difficult to identify because the attacker disseminates malicious content with a valid name. In addition, NDN employs request–response-based content dissemination, which is inefficient in supporting push-based content forwarding in VANET. Meanwhile, VNDN lacks a secure reputation management system. To this end, our contribution is three-fold. We initially propose a threshold-based content caching mechanism for CPA detection and prevention. This mechanism allows or rejects host vehicles to serve content based on their reputation. Secondly, we incorporate a blockchain system that ensures the privacy of every vehicle at roadside units (RSUs). Finally, we extend the scope of NDN from pull-based content retrieval to push-based content dissemination. The experimental evaluation results reveal that our proposed CPA detection mechanism achieves a 100% accuracy in identifying and preventing attackers. The attacker vehicles achieved a 0% cache hit ratio in our proposed mechanism. On the other hand, our blockchain results identified tempered blocks with 100% accuracy and prevented them from storing in the blockchain network. Thus, our proposed solution can identify and prevent CPA with 100% accuracy and effectively filters out tempered blocks. Our proposed research contribution enables the vehicles to store and serve trusted content in VNDN. © 2023 by the authors."

Given the consistently increasing prevalence of AD, the potential for emerging socio-economic challenges is significant. This underlines the importance of developing early detection strategies to mitigate the progression of this disease. Electroencephalograms (EEG) present a promising avenue for the early diagnosis of AD. EEG signals harbor crucial information pertaining to neuronal death triggered by amyloid plaque accumulation, a characteristic feature of AD. Spectral analysis reveals a deceleration in signal activity in AD patients when compared to healthy elderly individuals. However, this method is frequently compromised by low-frequency noise, necessitating the exploration of alternative approaches for analyzing EEG signal features for early AD detection. Considering the complex nature of EEG signals, it is hypothesized that pathological conditions, such as AD, may induce alterations in signal complexity. In this study, an early detection model for AD was simulated utilizing an approach that focused on EEG signal complexity. Complexity analysis, incorporating Spectral Entropy (SpecEn) and fractal dimensions, was calculated across 19 EEG channels from a total of 34 subjects (16 normal and 18 with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)). Performance validation of the proposed method was achieved through Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), yielding an accuracy of 82.4%, specificity of 77.8%, and sensitivity of 87.5%.

Given the volume of approximately 867 million daily tweets, the potential scale of cyberbullying incidents is immense, underscoring the necessity for automated detection systems for such messages. However, the context-sensitive nature of tweets can pose challenges to understanding message content, particularly in languages like Indonesian with potential for significant vocabulary discrepancies. This study aims to enhance cyberbullying detection by employing feature expansion using FastText, thereby addressing vocabulary-related comprehension issues in Indonesian-language tweets. Furthermore, text classification is performed using a Hybrid Deep Learning approach, integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM). This hybrid model leverages the strengths of both techniques, capturing local patterns and long-range dependencies within the data. The objective of this research is to evaluate the performance yielded by the application of FastText-enhanced feature expansion and Hybrid Deep Learning to an Indonesian Twitter dataset. This focus is motivated by the high accuracy of Hybrid Deep Learning for Twitter datasets in other languages, and the limited application of such methods to Indonesian-language datasets, which predominantly use supervised learning or deep learning. Analysis of 29,085 datasets demonstrated that the combined implementation of Hybrid Deep Learning and FastText-enhanced feature expansion achieved the highest accuracy, with CNN-BiLSTM and BiLSTM-CNN scoring 80.55% and 80.35% respectively. These findings validate the significant accuracy boost provided by FastText when integrated with Hybrid Deep Learning.

The simulation results show that at final time T = 2 seconds and T = 4 seconds, the position of pedestrian using the velocity function z6 is approximately 0.6 meters in front of the pedestrian with velocity function z2. A pedestrian using velocity function z6 is approximately 1 meter in front of the pedestrian with velocity function z2 at final time T = 6 seconds. The simulation continues until at final time T=8 seconds, the position of pedestrian using the velocity function z6 is approximately 1.2 meters in front of the pedestrian with velocity function z2. The density of z6 lower than z2, this is due to the higher velocity of z6 which causes pedestrians move faster. Based on numerical simulations, it shows that pedestrian with velocity function z6 is faster than with velocity function z2. Moreover, the linearity of coefficients of the polynomial functions is analyzed using hypothesis testing in this research. © 2023 AIP Publishing LLC."

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for detecting SARS-CoV-2 but has cost and time constraints. The sensitivity, specificity, and low cost of electrochemical biosensors make them an attractive alternative for virus detection. This study aims to develop and evaluate a high-performance desktop application for an electrochemical potentiostat-based SARS-CoV-2 test device, with a user-friendly interface that automatically interprets results, to expedite the testing process and improve accessibility, particularly in resource-limited settings. The application was built with the Electron framework and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming languages. Our findings indicate that the developed electrochemical potentiostat-based desktop application demonstrates high accuracy compared to commercial software, achieving rapid detection within 30 seconds. The graphical user interface was found to be straightforward and user-friendly, requiring minimal training for efficient system operation. Our electrochemical potentiostat-based desktop application represents a valuable tool for rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing, particularly in settings with limited resources.

The pavilion's response centred around public housing as an uncanny site, examining the psychological barriers faced by evicted communities during their transition to public housing. This study provides a conceptual analysis by exploring how the uncanny aspects of the occupants' experiences are expressed in installation using the illusory interior as a spatial metaphor. Through practice-led research, utilising ethnographic surrealism and narrative inquiries, data was gathered and translated into artistic mediums through various experiments. The study identifies several factors contributing to the uncanny sensation among public housing occupants, based on the occupants' experiences in public housing in Rancacili (Bandung) and Penjaringan (Jakarta), such as the shift from horizontal to vertical living, inadequate unit design, the absence of communal spaces, and a lack of ownership. The pavilion design attempts to integrate design theory and art practice, showcasing how installation art can express interiority within built spaces and extend it into installation art. Here, the uncanny acts as a methodological framework for critiquing space and transforming interiority into tangible forms by interpreting the actual conditions using installation art as a medium. © 2023, Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia.

The binder was used to bind the mixture of the two carbons, which were stuck together into the current collector. The CMC is a popular binder for supercapacitors due to its high wettability, environmentally friendly, and cheap. However, the CMC is easy to swelling in aqueous electrolytes, which reduces the mechanical properties of the electrode. Here, we propose alternative curing agents to improve the mechanical properties of CMC. The curing agents are epoxy resin, SBR-2 (styrene-butadiene rubber copolymer), and acrylic. For manufacturing the electrodes, the activated carbon, carbon black, CMC, and the curing agents were mixed together and were put on the nickel foam. The produced electrodes were then characterized using the adhesive test, contact angle test, and cyclic voltammetry. It was found that the epoxy resin is the finest curing agent of the CMC-based binder, with adhesive strength of 99.19%. However, the specific capacitance of the electrode with CMC-epoxy resin was lower (37.3 F/g) than the pristine CMC (54.69 F/g). This is caused by the highest contact angle of 33.0±0.13°which indicated the low wettability. The result of this study implies that the CMC-epoxy resin can improve the mechanical properties of the pristine CMC binder and can be an alternative binder for aqueous electrolyte supercapacitors.  © 2023 Author(s)."

Cooperatives as community economic organizations are players in the Industrial Revolution 4.0. Because of low competitiveness, cooperatives cannot create new and sustainable income streams, particularly digitalization capabilities. This study aims to encourage the competitiveness of cooperatives in the West Java region, Indonesia, in an Economic Society 5.0 by identifying the correlation between digital capabilities, digital orientation, employee resistance, government support, digital innovation and competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a quantitative method through surveys as data collection techniques by distributing questionnaires to 386 leaders of cooperatives in West Java. Hypothesis testing uses analysis technique of structural equation modeling with partial least squares tool. Findings: There are five hypotheses that are supported in the proposed model in this study. Digital orientation and government support have a positif and significant effect on digital innovation, in contrary; digital capability and employee resistance do not show any effect. Digital orientation, government support and digital capability also have a positive and significant effect on competitiveness. Meanwhile, employee resistance and digital innovation have no significant effect on competitiveness. Digital innovation was also found not to mediate the relationship between digital orientation, government support, digital capability and employee resistance with competitiveness.

This causal study surveyed 382 state-owned enterprises’ non-manager employees in Indonesia. The results demonstrate employees’ responses to internal and external CSR. Internal CSR, which primarily aims to improve employee performance, was found to improve employee satisfaction and engagement and lead to better performance more significantly than external CSR. Internal CSR had a higher effect on employee performance than external CSR. Compiling a scale of top priorities for corporate stakeholders became the leading choice to encourage long-term performance. The originality of this study is that the foundation of long-term performance ensures the corporation’s performance, and CSR lies in the strength of the microstructure at the individual level.

To create a realistic model, we incorporate sub-bandgap and heat losses in our calculations and utilize density-functional theory to determine the energy gap and optical properties of each material. Our findings suggest that the absorptivity of the material, especially when the sub-bandgap and heat losses are considered, can decrease the efficiency of TR cells. However, careful treatment of the absorptivity indicates that not all materials have the same trend of decrease in the TR cell efficiency when taking the loss mechanisms into account. We observe that GaSb exhibits the highest power density, while InP demonstrates the lowest one. Moreover, GaAs and InP exhibit relatively high efficiency without the sub-bandgap and heat losses, whereas InAs display lower efficiency without considering the losses, yet exhibit higher resistance to sub-bandgap and heat losses compared to the other materials, thus effectively becoming the best TR cell material in the III-V group of semiconductors. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd."

Depending on the channel model, wireless communication channels can also be affected by a number of key factors. In the Correlated Double Ring (CDR) wireless channel model, the channel gain parameters are affected by the movement of vehicles on the transmitter and receiver sides as well as the amount of scatterers surrounding the transmitter and receiver. When bits are transmitted across the CDR channel using a Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) multi-carrier system, the received bit will be degraded as a result of Doppler shift and multipath. To circumvent this, we use a Zero Forcing (ZF) equalizer to correct the erroneous bits on the receive side. In this study, we simulate data bits transmitted via a CDR channel at various speeds, ranging from low speed to high speed, using a GFDM multicarrier system. The ZF equalization method that we propose to overcome the higher Doppler frequency on a high-speed CDR channel of 95 m/s with the scatterer of 8 has been demonstrated to increase Bit Error Rate (BER) performance in comparison to the emergence of a ZF equalization scheme. In order to counteract the vast number of up to 16 multipaths on CDR channels, the ZF equalization approach can improve the BER performance at 95 m/s when compared to when it is not employed. On the Rician CDR channel, the ZF equalization algorithm can efficiently overcome the highly significant Doppler effect and multipath fading. © 2023 by the authors."

Several commercially-available wearable devices have recently been equipped with a BP monitoring feature. However, concerns about recalibration remain. Pulse transit time (PTT)-based estimation is required for initial calibration, followed by periodic recalibration. Recalibration using arm-cuff BP monitors is not practical during everyday activities. In this study, we investigated recalibration using PTT-based BP monitoring aided by a deep neural network (DNN) and validated the performance achieved with more practical wrist-cuff BP monitors. The PTT-based prediction produced a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.746 ± 1.529 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 3.448 ± 0.608 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) when tested with an arm-cuff monitor employing recalibration. Recalibration clearly improved the performance of both DNN and conventional linear regression approaches. We established that the periodic recalibration performed by a wrist-worn BP monitor could be as accurate as that obtained with an arm-worn monitor, confirming the suitability of wrist-worn devices for everyday use. This is the first study to establish the potential of wrist-cuff BP monitors as a means to calibrate BP monitoring devices that can reliably substitute for arm-cuff BP monitors. With the use of wrist-cuff BP monitoring devices, continuous BP estimation, as well as frequent calibrations to ensure accurate BP monitoring, are now feasible. © 2023, Korean Society of Medical and Biological Engineering."

The approach employed is a quantitative method that makes use of SEM-PLS as a data analysis tool. A questionnaire that was given to respondents was used to gather the data. According to the statistical findings, social media quality through destination satisfaction has no positive and significant influence on revisit intention but social media quality has a positive and significant influence on revisit intention through destination brand awareness.However social media quantity, social media credibility, and E-WOM all have a positive and significant effect on revisit intention.If the information circulating about Orchid Forest Cikole through Instagram is more credible and has a large amount of information, it can increase the level of revisit intention. The amount of intention to return can also be influenced by the more favorable reviews left by visitors. Additionally, destination satisfaction and destination brand recognition have an impact on visitors' intentions to return. The most important factor influencing the intention to return is destination satisfaction; if visitors are satisfied with their initial trip, they are far more likely to return. The stronger the impression created by Orchid Forest Cikole, the more likely it is that tourists will remember it and plan a return visit, demonstrating destination brand awareness. © 2023, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

In this project, we are interested in assisting university decision-making in supporting academic matters at Telkom University in the Distance Education (PJJ) study program. We use BI to provide analytics that can aid decision-making for various categories of users (students, lecturers, faculty staff, and other decision-makers). Furthermore, BI can monitor and analyze learning behavior and performance in a collegiate setting. BI can also be used to assess the structure of learning materials' content as well as the effectiveness of students in the learning process. The data we use is the data on the e-learning platform. On the one hand, educators cannot guarantee the effectiveness of the learning process due to a lack of instruments for measuring, assessing, and evaluating learners' performance in learning activities. Therefore, providing data that can track and evaluate learners' interactions in e-learning platforms is crucial. This research aims to find relevant data for BI analysis applied to e-learning in higher education from various stakeholder perspectives. The second objective is to visualize student activity data in lectures while using e-learning for study programs that apply asynchronous learning models. Learner activity data in this research will be displayed in the form of a dashboard whose results can be monitored by various stakeholders. For stakeholders such as faculty in higher education, the data collected before, during, and after attending lectures can help in decision-making for multiple parties and the development of learning strategies in the future.  © 2023 ACM."

One particular application, the recommendation of region-specific plant types, can mitigate losses in unfavorable conditions and optimize yields when growth conditions are ideal. However, accurately identifying the specific parameters of a field location and the diverse characteristics of plant types can pose a challenge. Deep learning has demonstrated efficacy as a predictive model within recommender systems, including those for plant type matching. However, building such models necessitates the identification of optimal solutions, taking into account the complexities of the problem scope and the unique characteristics of the domain. This paper introduces the development of a deep learning model architecture designed to recommend plant types best suited to specific regions. The model was constructed based on an extension of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a deep learning model recognized for its robust pattern recognition capabilities, making it suitable for classification tasks. It has the ability to discern patterns from datasets with a limited number of input features, thus making it an ideal choice for a plant type recommendation system. The Adagrad optimizer was employed for its advantage of partitioning the learning rate into smaller units, which significantly impacts the speed of the training process. Evaluation of this model was undertaken in a two-step process. First, the learning model's performance was assessed using a confusion matrix. Subsequently, the model's functionality was evaluated using real data from a city in Indonesia, investigating its ability to provide relevant recommendations based on the city's unique contextual characteristics. The results demonstrated a substantial accuracy level of 90%, underscoring the model's potential to effectively recommend suitable plant types for specific regional contexts. © 2023 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

Such a setup creates nonuniform spacing between energy levels of the quantum oscillator that increases with the energy level. We find that the Kerr quantum battery can store more energy than the qubit battery and reaches maximum stored energy faster than the harmonic oscillator battery. In particular, the average charging power of the Kerr quantum battery is larger than the qubit battery. Furthermore, most of the stored energy in the Kerr quantum battery can be extracted for work. All of the properties of the Kerr quantum battery are controlled by the strength of nonlinearity, in which the enhancement of the nonlinearity transforms the battery from a harmonic oscillator to a qubit. © 2023 Author(s)."

Many companies put a lot of effort into developing automated inspection systems to handle this issue. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning–based surface defect inspection system called the forceful steel defect detector (FDD), especially for steel surface defect detection. Our model adopts the state-of-the-art cascade R-CNN as the baseline architecture and improves it with the deformable convolution and the deformable RoI pooling to adapt to the geometric shape of defects. Besides, our model adopts the guided anchoring region proposal to generate bounding boxes with higher accuracies. Moreover, to enrich the point of view of input images, we propose the random scaling and the ultimate scaling techniques in the training and inference process, respectively. The experimental studies on the Severstal steel dataset, NEU steel dataset, and DAGM dataset demonstrate that our proposed model effectively improved the detection accuracy in terms of the average recall (AR) and the mean average precision (mAP) compared to state-of-the-art defect detection methods. We expect our innovation to accelerate the automation of industrial manufacturing process by increasing the productivity and by sustaining high product qualities. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

Mutation detection can be performed using alignment and machine learning techniques. However, alignment techniques require reference sequences, and machine learning techniques still cannot predict index mutation and require supporting tools. Therefore, in this research, a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) model was proposed to detect the type and index mutation faster and without reference sequences and supporting tools. The architecture of the proposed TCN model is specifically designed for sequential labeling tasks on DNA sequence data. This allows for the detection of the mutation type of each nucleotide in the sequence, and if the nucleotide has a mutation, the index mutation can be obtained. The proposed model also uses 2-mers and 3-mers mapping techniques to improve detection performance. Based on the tests that have been carried out, the proposed TCN model can achieve the highest F1-score of 0.9443 for COSMIC dataset and 0.9629 for RSCM dataset, Additionally, the proposed TCN model can detect index mutation six times faster than BiLSTM model.

To create a reliable identifier, performance results must be as high as possible. In this study, we developed XGB5hmC, a high-performance identifier of RNA 5hmC. We use extreme gradient boosting (XGB) as the best model. In addition, we investigated other models, such as random forest (RF), ada boosting (AB), and gradient boosting (GB). First, IlearnPlus was used to run 15 different machine learning models using 35 different descriptors to select the best descriptors. Then, it was decided that the composition of k-spaced nucleic acid pairs (CKSNAP), pseudo-K-tuple nucleotide composition (PseKNC), and position-specific trinucleotide propensity single strand (PSTNPss) are the best descriptors. Subsequently, the features were combined and reduced in dimension using chi-squared test filtering. Using these filtered features and the XGB model, we obtained better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.

During training, we applied five-fold cross-validation with a grid-search method to select the best model and determine the optimal hyperparameter settings.

It has been the main cause of death worldwide. The fastest way to detect MI is by using an electrocardiogram (ECG) device, which generates graphs of heartbeats morphology over a certain period of time. Patients with MI need fast intervention as delay will lead to worsening heart conditions or failure. To improve MI diagnosis, much research has been carried out to come up with a fast and reliable system to aid automatic MI detection and prediction from ECG readings. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with memory has produced more accurate results in predicting time series problems. Convolutional neural networks have also shown good results in terms of solving prediction problems. However, CNN models do not have the capability of remembering temporal information. This research proposes hybrid models of CNN and RNN techniques to predict MI. Specifically, CNN-LSTM and CNN-BILSTM models have been developed. The PTB XL dataset is used to train the models. The models predict ECG input as representing MI symptoms, healthy heart conditions or other cardiovascular diseases. Deep learning models offer automatic feature extraction, and our models take advantage of automatic feature extraction. The other superior models used their own feature extraction algorithm. This research proposed a straightforward architecture that depends mostly on the capability of the deep learning model to learn the data. Performance evaluation of the models shows overall accuracy of 89% for CNN LSTM and 91% for the CNN BILSTM model. © 2023 by the authors."

Ethnicity is one of the soft biometric feature categories useful in data analysis for commercial, public, and health sectors. Ethnicity classification begins with face detection as a preprocessing process to determine a human’s presence; then, the feature representation is extracted from the isolated facial image to predict the ethnicity class. This study utilized four handcrafted features (multi-local binary pattern (MLBP), histogram of gradient (HOG), color histogram, and speeded-up-robust-features-based (SURF-based)) as the basis for the generation of a compact-fusion feature. The compact-fusion framework involves optimal feature selection, compact feature extraction, and compact-fusion feature representation. The final feature representation was trained and tested with the SVM One Versus All classifier for ethnicity classification. When it was evaluated in two large datasets, UTKFace and Fair Face, the proposed framework achieved accuracy levels of 89.14%, 82.19%, and 73.87%, respectively, for the UTKFace dataset with four or five classes and the Fair Face dataset with four classes.

There are limited studies regarding the factors of COVID-19 mortality in Indonesia with a more balanced dataset. The previous studies only implemented logistic regression, sensitive to the imbalanced dataset. Meanwhile, other countries implemented survival analysis to overcome the problem. Most survival analyses using Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model require the variables to be time-independent. To this end, this study aims to identify the risk factors for COVID-19 mortality in Indonesia using a survival analysis approach using Jakarta as a case study. We use the Piecewise Exponential Model (PEM) to overcome the time-dependent problem in CPH. The findings show that the COVID-19 mortality does not differ the gender. In contrast, it differs the elderly with 3.5 times higher to be deceased. Dyspnea, malaise, and pneumonia are the primary symptoms associated with COVID-19 mortality. From the comorbidities, diabetes and chronic disease are related to COVID-19, while hypertension and heart attack are still considerable in clustered contexts. The advanced treatment using intubation and extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) produces a relatively large hazard risk of COVID-19 mortality. Based on the findings, we suggest that collaboration among the government, society, and hospitals is vital in overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic and minimizing the COVID-19 death.  © 2014 IEEE."

The sample WO3 has polycrystalline properties with a monoclinic crystal structure. The ethyl glycol monomethyl ether (EGME) acts as a structure-directing agent in the nanorod formation with the loose density of the WO3 sample. The nanorod form of WO3 produces a high gas response value of 68.4 to 2 ppm of NO2 gas at a quite low operation temperature of 150 °C. The morphology of WO3 modified by EGME supports the gas response characteristics of the WO3 sensor to NO2 gas.

In addition, the proposed data communication system uses the Internet of Things (IoT). The DHT22 sensor readings are used as control parameters on the NodeMCU for setting and controlling thermoelectricity. Throughout the measurement process, the NodeMCU also records the data and sends it to the monitoring application. The monitoring application is designed by wireless communication and applied on a mobile device.

Most driving fatigue detection studies concentrated on improving feature engineering and classification methods. We propose a novel driving fatigue detection framework concentrating on the development of the preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification stages to improve the classification accuracy of fatigue states. The proposed driving fatigue detection framework measures fatigue using a two-electrode ECG. The resampling method and heart rate variability analysis were used to extract features from the ECG data, and an ensemble learning model was utilized to classify fatigue states. To achieve the best model performance, 40 possible scenarios were applied: a combination of 5 resampling scenarios, 2 feature extraction scenarios, and 4 classification model scenarios. It was discovered that the combination of a resampling method with a window duration of 300 s and an overlap of 270 s, 54 extracted features, and AdaBoost yielded an optimum accuracy of 98.82% for the training dataset and 81.82% for the testing dataset.

In this case, people can access data as freely as they wish. However, in some institutions, such as banks, it is necessary to secure or protect internal data accessibility. Therefore, it is necessary to secure access. Various methods have been proposed for securing bank data access, such as One Time Passwords (OTP). OTP is usually sent via public channels. One attack that might threaten the OTP is hacking it after obtaining the message that includes the OTP. Thus, if an attacker suspects that a message contains an OTP, the data can be hacked, and the attacker can use this OTP to access the bank data. To overcome this problem, Sheshasaayee et al. proposed a method that embeds the OTP into a sentence based on Glyph. After embedding the OTP, a sentence is sent to the receivers. However, using this method, the sentence can raise suspicion because there are many Glyph characters in the sentence. Therefore, this research proposed a method for embedding the OTP into a sentence without raising suspicion about the attacker. In this case, the OTP is embedded into alphabetic characters used in the words of a sentence. Based on the experiment result, the proposed method is more natural than Sheshasaayee’s method since only 10% of respondents suggested that some sentences generated by the proposed method are irregular. In comparison, about 72 % of the respondents suggested that the sentence generated by Sheshasaayee’s method is irregular (not natural). Finally, it can be proved that using the proposed method, the sentence that the OTP embeds is more natural than Sheshasaayee’s. © 2023, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

These frictional forces cause torques on the ball so that the ball spins in the same direction as the finger's rotational direction. If the finger rotates clockwise, the ball's rotational direction will also be clockwise and vice versa. When the ball is cut into half, it is rotated similarly to when spinning a full ball. Thus, we can easily guess that its direction of rotation will be the same as when circling a full ball. What if the ball is spun differently? The half ball is spun using one fingertip from the bottom center of the inside, as shown in Figs. 1(c) and (d). What is the direction of rotation of the half ball? Would it be the same as when the ball is rotated from the outside? It turns out that the spin direction of the half ball is the opposite of the finger's spin direction. The same result was observed when using a pen or a stick to rotate the half ball from the center base [Fig. 1(d) and supplemental video. Finally, suppose we shift the finger's tip to any location so that it will no longer be at the center of the bottom of the object. In that case, the half ball's rotation direction is similar to the one of the finger or stick. Why does this happen? In this paper, the answer to this question is presented.  © 2023 Author(s)."

They give improved insight to identify the critical factors from the student that greatly impact student achievement and education quality. In university, research shows that early years are essential for student success in their education. Sadly, not all students can pass these critical times properly. Several indicators can indicate whether students undergo this stage well or not. Currently, the most common method to solve this problem is using an academic advisor (AA) to monitor each student. However, this method's success rate is around 50%. To increase the success of the counseling program, especially in these early times, automated tools are built to check and predict the student's condition. The tools will be a program with machine learning to predict the student's graduation time and final GPA. Even though the technique used on ML is common, the implementation to provide a proper prediction for the counseling purpose gives new insight into how ML could help counseling purposes to help students succeed on their academic journey. The prediction software was designed in mind that credit load does not always correlate with student performance. It is more of a supporting variable, with the prediction weighing more on student GPA as the main variable. The prediction result will help AA to determine those who potentially could have a problem in the future so they can prepare adequately for counseling to help them make sure that they graduate with adequate GPAs and achieve better education.  © 2023 IEEE."

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope were used to focus on the characterization of bioplastics. For the antimicrobial test results, even though the bacteria of Gram- positive and Gram-negative were in the same group, the minimum inhibitory concentration values of the bacteria differed. Furthermore, the spectra were recorded from 400 4000 cm-1. The findings demonstrate that the treated fibres exhibited a rough surface, pores, a larger diameter, and a strong bond with the Ceiba pentandra fibers/PVA. Additionally, untreated fibres have a smooth surface, no holes, a smaller diameter, and a looser bonding with PVA than treated fibres.

The equivalent coding structures are both for transmitter and receiver to: (i) reduce the encoding and decoding computational complexity, and (ii) search possibility of finding new coding scheme and observe their performances. We evaluate the validity of the method by confirming the equality in performances of the SLDPC codes in terms of bit-error-rate (BER) followed by investigation on their performance gaps to the Shannon limit via a series of computer simulations. The results show that the SLDPC codes have the same BER performance with that of the low density generator matrix (LDGM) codes confirming the validity of the proposed equivalent matrix derivation. This result indicates that different graphs can provide the same performances, because their equivalent matrices are the same.

Recently, it has become a common practice to use an online recipe to select the ingredients that match an individual’s meal plan and healthy diet preference. The information from online recipes can be extracted and used to develop various food-related applications. Named entity recognition (NER) is often used to extract such information. However, the problem in building an NER system lies in the massive amount of data needed to train the classifier, especially on a specific domain, such as food. There are food NER datasets available, but they are still quite limited. Thus, we proposed an iterative self-training approach called semi-supervised multi-model prediction technique (SMPT) to construct a food ingredient NER dataset. SMPT is a deep ensemble learning model that employs the concept of self-training and uses multiple pre-trained language models in the iterative data labeling process, with a voting mechanism used as the final decision to determine the entity’s label. Utilizing the SMPT, we have created a new annotated dataset of ingredient entities obtained from the Allrecipes website named FINER.

In addition, CS is exploited in medical imaging (MI) to support efficient sampling, compression, transmission, and storage of a large amount of MI. Although CS of MI has been extensively investigated, the effect of color space in CS of MI has not yet been studied in the literature. To fulfill these requirements, this article proposes a novel CS of MI based on hue-saturation value (HSV), using spread spectrum Fourier sampling (SSFS) and sparsity averaging with reweighted analysis (SARA). An HSV loop that performs SSFS is proposed to obtain a compressed signal. Next, HSV–SARA is proposed to reconstruct MI from the compressed signal. A set of color MIs is investigated, such as colonoscopy, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and eye, and wireless capsule endoscopy images. Experiments were performed to show the superiority of HSV–SARA over benchmark methods in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), structural similarity (SSIM) index, and measurement rate (MR). The experiments showed that a color MI, with a resolution of (Formula presented.) pixels, could be compressed by the proposed CS at MR of 0.1, and could be improved in terms of SNR being 15.17% and SSIM being 2.53%.

Consumers have difficulty verifying coffee quality according to the price they pay. However, innovative technologies such as blockchain emerge with the potential to support the coffee supply chain to be more transparent and traceable. Blockchain technology is a distributed database that allows for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof record-keeping, which makes it an ideal tool for tracking the movement of coffee beans throughout the supply chain, from farmers to roasters to retailers. Each step in the coffee supply chain could be logged and tracked using blockchain, thus supporting greater transparency. Traceability would make it easier to identify and track any issues or irregularities in the supply chain. We propose a model to transform a coffee industry supply chain business process into a blockchainable workflow. In addition, an application was developed to allow each stakeholder in the supply chain to contribute to the data collection and monitor the status of each coffee batch. The application prototype was implemented and evaluated in one of the coffee industries in Indonesia. This research will benefit farmers in getting fair prices and end-consumers getting quality assurance. © 2023 The Author(s)"

Previous research considered five domains associated with the social vulnerability index in the context of pandemic infection management and mitigation in the community, such as socioeconomic conditions, demographic composition, housing and hygiene, availability of health care facilities, and epidemiological factors related to COVID-19. The Katadata Insight Center (KIC) investigates the vulnerability index of Indonesian provinces to the coronavirus based on the risks of regional characteristics, population health, and mobility. There is a chance that the supporting data is either incomplete or missing, which is a common flaw that influences the prediction system’s results and renders it ineffective. This paper will compare the kNN-based imputation method with the mean imputation to handle missing data, which causes the provincial vulnerability index in Indonesia to be measured incorrectly. The vulnerability index associated with COVID-19 should be one of the factors considered by the Indonesian government when making decisions or establishing a lockdown strategy and large-scale restriction rules in each province. When missing data is discovered, kNN imputation and mean imputation can be used as a solution. Based on the results of the experiments, the mean imputation has a much lower average RMSE performance than the kNN imputation method in the dataset of vulnerability index in dealing with COVID-19 in Indonesia. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

The numerical scheme is based on the one-layer non-hydrostatic (NH-1L) model, a phase-solving model that can account for weakly dispersive waves. In this paper, the model is extended to include a time-varying solid bed. This NH-1L scheme is very efficient because, at each time step, only a tridiagonal Poisson pressure matrix needs to be solved. In this study, the capability of the NH-1L scheme to simulate landslide-generated waves is demonstrated by executing two types of landslide motion: constant speed and with acceleration and deceleration. Validation was performed using analytical solutions of the linear weakly dispersive (LWD) model, as well as experimental data. The NH-1L model was capable of describing the generation and propagation of water waves by a submarine landslide from relatively intermediate water to shallow water depths. © 2023 by the authors."

Traffic flow can specify its condition, whether it is a free flow or very heavy traffic. Traffic condition is the most important criterion used to find the best route from an origin to a destination. This paper collects the traffic condition for several road segments which are calculated based on the degree of saturation by using two methods, namely, (1) by counting the number of vehicles using object detection in the public closed-circuit television (CCTV) stream, and (2) by requesting the traffic information (vehicle’s speed) using TomTom. Both methods deliver the saturation degree and calculate the traffic condition for each road segment. Based on the experiments, the average error rate obtained by counting the number of vehicles on Pramuka–Cihapit and Trunojoyo was 0–2 cars, 2–3 motorcycles, and 0–1 for others. Meanwhile, the average error on Merdeka-Aceh Intersection reached 6 cars, 11 motorcycles, and 1 for other vehicles. The average speed calculation for the left side of the road is more accurate than the right side, and the average speed on the left side is less than 3.3 km/h. Meanwhile, on the right side, the differences between actual and calculated vehicle speeds are between 11.088 and 22.222 km/h. This high error rate is caused by (1) the low resolution of the public CCTV, (2) some obstacles interfering with the view of CCTV, (3) the misdetection of the type of vehicles, and by (4) the vehicles moving too fast. The collected dataset can be used in further studies to solve the congestion problem, especially in Indonesia. © 2023 by the authors."

The diagnose of epilepsy can be done by analyzing the electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Neurologist needs to find minimum one seizure (ictal) condition in the recording through a visual inspection. However, this process is time-consuming and needs a lot of practice. A computer-aided diagnose to detect the ictal condition is needed to assist the neurologist in inspecting the EEG signal recordings. This study proposes the use of Wavelet energy (WE) as the feature extraction method to extract the information of the EEG signal. The calculation of WE is done in five EEG sub-bands producing five features for each signal. The features then fed to Random Forest (RF) classifier to classify three epileptic EEG conditions using five classification problems (CPs), covering the ictal vs. non-ictal condition. The combination is able to reach 100% of accuracy to classify interictal vs. ictal conditions (CP2). While the other CPs achieves accuracy from 73% to 98%.

However, as the wireless channel used to send the data is a shared public network, the transmitted data are prone to hackers and attacks. This paper proposes the Securebox architecture to manage secure data transfer from the onboard Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) to the data server in TCMS. The architecture is comprised of four main functions: network management, buffer management, data management, and security management. The architecture has been successfully developed in an HSM (Hardware Security Modul) and verified using alpha and beta software testing to form a secure TCMS. From the real-time testing phase in an electric-diesel train, the average performance of the AES-based HSM showed 55% faster time processing with unnoticed 0.1% added memory usage compared to the 3DES. The secure TCMS also withstands MITM attack and provides end-to-end data security compared to the (Mobile Station) MS to Base Station (BS) only in GSM-R. © 2023 by the authors."

At worst, dementia is often called a major neurocognitive disorder or senile disease. One of the most common types of dementia after Alzheimer’s is vascular dementia. Vascular dementia is closely related to cerebrovascular disease, one of which is stroke. Post-stroke patients with recurrent onset have the potential to develop dementia. An accurate diagnosis is needed for proper therapy management to ensure the patient’s quality of life and prevent it from worsening. The gold standard diagnostic of vascular dementia is complex, includes psychological tests, complete memory tests, and is evidenced by medical imaging of brain lesions. However, brain imaging methods such as CT-Scan, PET-Scan, and MRI have high costs and cannot be routinely used in a short period. For more than two decades, electroencephalogram signal analysis has been an alternative in assisting the diagnosis of brain diseases associated with cognitive decline. Traditional EEG analysis performs visual observations of signals, including rhythm, power, and spikes. Of course, it requires a clinician expert, time consumption, and high costs. Therefore, a quantitative EEG method for identifying vascular dementia in post-stroke patients is discussed in this study. This study used 19 EEG channels recorded from normal elderly, post-stroke with mild cognitive impairment, and post-stroke with dementia. The QEEG method used for feature extraction includes relative power, coherence, and signal complexity; the evaluation performance of normal-mild cognitive impairment-dementia classification was conducted using Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor. The results of the classification simulation showed the highest accuracy of 96% by Gaussian SVM with a sensitivity and specificity of 95.6% and 97.9%, respectively. This study is expected to be an additional criterion in the diagnosis of dementia, especially in post-stroke patients. © 2023 by the authors."

Prison institutions play an active role in building character and improving prisoners' skills by providing various empowerment programs to increase opportunities for their economic potential. However, these programs are considered not optimal in increasing the entrepreneurial intentions of prisoners. This study aims to identify the effects of prison entrepreneurship programs, entrepreneurial resilience and self-efficacy as drivers in increasing prisoners' entrepreneurial intentions. This study also examines the effect of these variables focusing on prisoners with neither entrepreneurial experience nor entrepreneurial training. Design/methodology/approach: This study deployed a quantitative method by distributing a questionnaire to prisoners involved in talent and skill development activities (called BIMKER, an abbreviation in Indonesian, which means Work Guidance), a compulsory program provided by prison institutions. A total of 204 prisoners, including 70 with no entrepreneurial experience, completed the research questionnaire in one of the prison institutions in Indonesia. Partial least sequential-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used as the analytical technique. Findings: The study findings show that the prison entrepreneurship program has not been able to influence prisoners' entrepreneurial intentions directly. However, the prison entrepreneurship program has a positive and significant effect on increasing prisoners' self-efficacy and entrepreneurial resilience that ultimately encourages the emergence of entrepreneurial intentions. Entrepreneurial resilience was found not to affect entrepreneurial intentions for prisoners with no entrepreneurial experience and who have never attended entrepreneurship training. Originality/value: This study identifies the drivers of prisoners' entrepreneurial intentions, including prison entrepreneurship programs, self-efficacy and entrepreneurial resilience. These can be used as references to build understanding at the theoretical level and can be adopted practically.

However, there is a research opportunity to use Wi-Fi fingerprint localization in an indoor keyless entry system. The use of Wi-Fi as a solution is low cost because of the already hdeployed Wi-Fi access points (AP) around buildings. This study uses ensemble learning to utilize Wi-Fi fingerprints for keyless entry systems in indoor environments. The first step of this research is to obtain the UJIIndoorLoc Data Set, an open-source Wi-Fi fingerprint dataset. The next step is to design and implement a keyless entry system based on Wi-Fi Fingerprint. We compared four ensemble learning methods: Random Forest, AdaBoost, gradient boosting, and XGBoost. We use several metrics to compare the four methods, namely r2, the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), and the equal error rate (EER). The test results show that for localization based on ensemble regression, XGBoost has the best performance compared to the other three ensemble methods for both longitude and latitude predictions. The r2 values are 0.94 and 0.98, respectively. For authentication based on ensemble classification, the gradient-boosting model performance increases as the number of weak learners increases. The optimum number of weak learners is 60. With AUROC = 0.99, gradient boosting outperforms random forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost on authentication. Finally, our authentication method has EER = 0.01, which outperforms other state-of-the-art keyless entry systems. This research focuses on local building map datasets for future work. © 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved."

Inside the restaurant industry, common dynamic pricing strategy adopted is the pricing cut policy. The purpose of this study is to propose a pricing cut policy obtained from dynamic pricing model optimization in order to maximize profit on a restaurant through a partnership with online food delivery services. In the first phase, we determine menu items that the pricing cut will be applied to using menu engineering, one of the methods used in the restaurant industry to evaluate menu items performance. In the next phase, we forecast demand for the next period by modeling the effect of price on sales history. In the third phase, the demand model is substituted into the dynamic pricing model, which is then optimized by using non-linear programming method. The optimization result shows that the proposed model can increase restaurant revenue up to 28% compared to historical revenue.

One of the natural disasters that often hit Indonesia are earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, floods, droughts, hurricanes, landslides, and others. The location and time of occurrence of natural disasters that cannot be predicted by humans which then has the potential to take many lives. The fast and precise handling of arrests by the SAR (search and rescue) team is one of the efforts to reduce the number of people who lose their lives. But in reality, the SAR team experienced problems during the process of taking victims. Starting from terrain that is difficult to reach to the limited equipment needed. One solution to the problems that occur due to delays in post-disaster handling is to develop tools that can assist the identification process so that it can facilitate the search for victims after a natural disaster. In this study implemented a system to be able to detect victims of natural disasters which aims to help develop equipment for the SAR team to find victims of natural disasters based on image processing. Image processing is intended to detect whether victims of natural disasters are still alive or not. The algorithm used to detect whether or not there are victims uses the You Only Look Once (YOLO) version 5 method which has a high enough value of 90.75% to be able to detect human objects. After being detected by humans, the system will continue the live or dead detection through the specified skeleton point using Tensorflow MoveNet with 100% accuracy from the 14 videos tried.  © 2023 IEEE."

One way to limit the spread is by limiting people's mobility through transportation. The Provincial Government of Jakarta has implemented the Large-Scale Social Restriction Transitional Phase-1 since June 5th, 2020, to limit people mobility and the odd-even policies August 3rd, 2020, to limit private vehicles. To assess the effectiveness of these policies against the positivity rate of COVID-19 cases in Jakarta, we used data exploration and significant tests (pre-and post-condition). The result shows that the odd-even policy significantly impacts private transportation mobility, mobility in public transportation, and the COVID-19 positivity rate in Jakarta. The relationship between those three parameters is linearly significant. The odd-even policy stimulates people to switch from private to public transportations and increases the positivity rate of COVID-19. The odd-even policy effectively reduces the mobility of private transportation but insignificantly reduces the positivity rate of COVID-19 in Jakarta. The results can be used as insights for policy decision-makers to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.  © 2023 Author(s)."

Femto hydropower is compact and easy to set up, storing water in homes' water tanks. This paper develops a prototype for a domestic femto hydropower system and assesses its efficiency. To power the LED Spotlight, the generator will first produce energy with a voltage of 12V D.C., then convert that voltage to A.C. using a boost inverter, and then step it up to 240V with a transformer. Residents who prepare food or wash dishes cause water to flow from the tank into the turbine, which rotates the turbine shaft. The generator supplies 12V D.C., which is stored in the 7Ah battery. The purpose of this project and the performance of D.C. to A.C. converter were evaluated using femto hydropower. The output of this project is 212 V-240 V, which is generated from 12V D.C. Depending on the water pressure, the LED Spotlight may also be able to obtain up to 12.05W of its electricity from femto hydropower. It can endure for six hours, depending on the load. It takes around two days to fully charge the 7Ah battery as it can only supply 12 V D.C., except when everyone is asleep.

Automated emotion recognition has garnered increasing interest due to its potential applications in various fields, such as human-computer interaction, machine learning, robotic control, and driver emotional state monitoring. With artificial intelligence and computational power advancements, visual emotion recognition has become a prominent research area. Despite extensive research employing machine learning algorithms like convolutional neural networks (CNN), challenges remain concerning input data processing, emotion classification scope, data size, optimal CNN configurations, and performance evaluation. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive CNN-based model for real-time detection and classification of five primary emotions: anger, happiness, neutrality, sadness, and surprise. We employ the Amsterdam Dynamic Facial Expression Set – Bath Intensity Variations (ADFES-BIV) video dataset, extracting image frames from the video samples. Image processing techniques such as histogram equalization, color conversion, cropping, and resizing are applied to the frames before labeling. The Viola-Jones algorithm is then used for face detection on the processed grayscale images. We develop and train a CNN on the processed image data, implementing dropout, batch normalization, and L2 regularization to reduce overfitting. The ideal hyperparameters are determined through trial and error, and the model's performance is evaluated. The proposed model achieves a recognition accuracy of 99.38%, with the confusion matrix, recall, precision, F1 score, and processing time further quantifying its performance characteristics. The model's generalization performance is assessed using images from the Warsaw Set of Emotional Facial Expression Pictures (WSEFEP) and Extended Cohn-Kanade Database (CK+) datasets. The results demonstrate the efficiency and usability of our proposed approach, contributing valuable insights into real-time visual emotion recognition. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Therefore, research in this field has become quite popular. Moreover, human handwriting pattern recognition is needed for several things, one of them being character recognition. Recognition of Arabic handwriting is complex because everyone has different characteristics in writing and Arabic characters have quite abstract shapes and patterns. From previous research, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a deep learning-based algorithm, has a fairly high accuracy value when used for public datasets such as AHDB and private datasets. In this study, private datasets are used with a fairly high level of complexity because the respondents appointed to write Arabic letters come from different age categories. The CNN architecture used in this research is the architecture developed by Yan LeCun known as LeNet-5. The local dataset used was 8400 images, with details of 6720 for training data (each letter has 240 images) and 1680 for testing data (each letter has 60 images).

Although household consumption is an essential source of economic growth, households’ failure to meet their financial obligations will be one of the causes of economic problems if the increase in consumption is largely financed by household borrowing. Therefore, this study aims to analyse the nexus between households’ indebtedness and consumption and the roles of household characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a microdata set of the Household Expenditure and Income Survey in 2019, which contained a simple random sampling of 4,730 households. Findings: Using a simultaneous equations model, our results show a negative nexus between households’ consumption and their indebtedness. We find that household savings and size have an indirect impact on the debt service ratio, while the assets and total debt repayment instalments indirectly influence household consumption. We also identify differences in the relationship between the gender of the household head, rural and urban locations and income groups in consumption and indebtedness. Research limitations/implications: The implication of this study is that governments should adopt several programmes to increase the awareness of household financial and debt management, especially for those in the low-income group. Originality/value: This study contributes to the empirical literature by establishing a microeconomic perspective of consumption and an indebtedness model focusing on the differences in household characteristics in explaining consumption and indebtedness. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

An electronic patient record (EPR) is a computer-based database of health data. The EPR must be protected from unauthorized parties, errors in patients diagnosing and verifying the authenticity of data. Watermarking is a method of inserting information data such as EPR into a digital data. In this study, we propose Compressive Sensing (CS) method to be applied to transform domain-based medical image watermarking. Those method are applied to medical image watermarking based on two transform domains, namely Fast Discrete Curvelet Transform (FDCuT) and Discrete Cosine Transform. CS can secure and also reduce the size of the watermark. The technique of inserting a watermark into the host uses the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method by replacing the diagonal matrix on the host with a watermark diagonal matrix. This research has a good performance of imperceptibility and robustness with PSNR values of 57.3295â dB, SSIM 0.9998, NC 1, and BER 0. This watermarking scheme is also resistant to JPEG compression attacks, noise addition, signal processing, and geometry attacks. Therefore, this watermarking scheme can protect patient medical records safely and has a high level of robustness.  © 2023 Author(s)."

If the receiving end is aware of this Coherence Time parameter, another Coherence Time related parameter, Doppler Shift, will be recognized. Very few of the numerous Doppler Shift studies use Coherence Time as the basis for detecting Doppler Shift. This is because the Coherence Time parameters for each channel model will have different values and be hard to detect. Our previous studies have been carried out to determine the Coherence Time detection method on a V2V channel but its correlation coefficient was below 0.5, which is not compatible with the theory. Therefore, this study aims to enhance the method with better correlation coefficient value above 0.5. This method was applied on V2V channel with moving scatterers and Correlated Double-Ring (CDR) channel models. This study can be therefore utilized as a guide for detecting the duration of Coherence Time on wireless communications channels, with the findings of Coherence Time detection being compared to the Coherence Time value calculated theoretically to get the accuracy rate. The accuracy rate on the V2V channel with moving scatterer has an accuracy value of up to 80.2%, while the accuracy rate on the CDR channel has an average accuracy value of up to 90.2%, according to the test results of the Coherence Time detection method that we present. Further, our proposed method could be implemented to determine the data symbol sent in a single frame in order to obtain a higher BER value in wireless communications such as Wi-fi, Cellular or V2V. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Here, we consider the effects of broken rotational symmetry on the Dirac cone of an AHE material by adding trigonal warping terms to the Dirac Hamiltonian. We calculate the linear optical conductivity semianalytically to show how by breaking the rotational symmetry we can obtain a topologically distinct phase. The addition of trigonal warping terms causes the emergence of additional Dirac cones, which when combined has a total Chern number of ∓1 instead of ±1/2. This results in drastic changes in the anomalous Hall and longitudinal conductivity. The trigonal warping terms also activate the higher-order Hall responses which do not exist in a R-symmetric conventional Dirac material. We found the presence of a nonzero second-order Hall current even in the absence of a Berry curvature dipole. This shift current is also unaffected by the chirality of the Dirac cone, which should lead to a nonzero Hall current in time-reversal symmetric systems.  © 2023 American Physical Society. "

Therefore, this study aims to design and implement a solar powered water pump for irrigation. Based on the research results, the 50 WP solar powered water pump can operate in sunny, overcast, and cloudy weather. The low intensity of solar radiation on cloudy days causes the irrigation time to be longer than sunny days. This is because the power output of the off grid solar power system is strongly influenced by the test weather conditions. In sunny conditions, the highest power resulted was 33.01 Watt, while in cloudy and overcast conditions the maximum power obtained was only 27.60 Watt and 24.34 Watt respectively.

Furthermore, it is determined whether the transition goes from normal to abnormal subjects by calculating the energy in the time-frequency domain signal. The test results show that during the transition period, the energy of the gait signal tends to be higher than during the walking period. © 2023 by the authors."

This research studies the effects of both Daubechies wavelet basis function (DWBF) and decomposition level (DL) on the performance of detecting atrial fibrillation (AF) based on electrocardiograms (ECGs). ECG signals (consisting of 23 AF data and 18 normal data from MIT-BIH) were decomposed at various levels using several types of DWBF to obtain four wavelet coefficient features (WCFs), namely, minimum (min), maximum (max), mean, and standard deviation (stdev). These features were then classified to detect the presence of AF using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Distribution of training and testing data for the SVM uses the 5-fold cross-validation (CV) principle to produce optimum detection performance. In this study, AF detection performance is measured and analyzed based on accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics. The results of the analysis show that accuracy tends to decrease with increases in the decomposition level. In addition, it becomes stable in various types of DWBF. For both sensitivity and specificity, the results of the analysis show that increasing the decomposition level also causes a decrease in both sensitivity and specificity. However, unlike the accuracy, changing the DWBF type causes both two metrics to fluctuate over a wider range. The statistical results also indicate that the highest AF accuracy detection (i.e., 94.17%) is obtained at the Daubechies 2 (DB2) function with a decomposition level of 4, whereas the highest sensitivity, 97.57%, occurs when the AF detection uses DB6 with a decomposition level of 2. Finally, DB2 with decomposition level 4 results in 96.750% for specificity. The finding of this study is that selecting the appropriate DL has a more significant effect than DWBF on AF detection using WCF. © 2023 by the authors."

Several approaches can be used to build DDS, one of which is using face landmark information to estimate the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR). However, this technique is only good at detecting frontal faces. To handle this problem, we developed a modified EAR-based DDS system with additional information on the direction vector of the face. To identify the driver condition, we use an Attention Mesh model to extract the face landmark of the driver. Then by using the EAR technique, we can estimate the eye state of the driver. Then we use the projection constant and machine learning technique to process both the EAR information and the direction vector of the face to estimate better eye conditions. The experimental results show that our model is the most balanced in accuracy and speed. The highest result comes from the gradient boosting classifier and extra trees classifier tested on the CEW dataset and the dataset we collected on the driver's environment in daytime and nighttime conditions. Meanwhile, in terms of computation speed, the traditional EAR thresholding method is still faster than our method, up to around 10x faster. Even so, our method is still fast enough to achieve real-time detection.  © 2023 IEEE."

However, when faced with event logs from big data, modelling will force the existing applications to work hard. So far, the steps used are sampling of event logs resulting from the system. The problem arising is that the sampling process must be done several times because it has to check the desired fitness value on the sample taken. If the fitness value has not been got, then the sample size is added and the fitness value at a certain iteration is calculated until the required fitness value is met. There are many steps to do with this mechanism. Thus, this paper proposes an alternative way to reduce the steps by using an appropriate sampling technique. The mechanism used is statistical-based sampling simulation in the event log datasets to determine which sampling method is stable in the process modelling. The simulation results show that the sampling method using Cluster Random Sampling with the error rate or Alpha of 1 % has a relatively stable process model and can represent the process model resulting from the event log population. © 2023, DAAAM International Vienna.

However, this convenience also introduces various challenges, including copyright infringement, data theft, and the imperative need for robust ownership identification during data transmission across open networks. Addressing these concerns, watermarking emerges as a practical solution by discreetly embedding confidential personal information within other data. This paper introduces a watermarking technique designed to enhance the security of medical images, utilizing a fusion of the Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform and spread spectrum (DTCWT-SS) methods. The watermark image undergoes a pre-processing stage involving a spread spectrum modulation technique employing a random pseudo-noise code. Subsequently, the watermark series is meticulously embedded into the DTCWT-based host image, resulting in the creation of a watermarked image. At the receiving end, the watermarked image undergoes processing by DTCWT, and the optimal subband is carefully selected to extract the original watermark with high fidelity. The proposed scheme achieves an impressive peak signal-to-noise ratio of over 50 dB for each medical image modality, underscoring the preservation of image quality despite watermarking. Moreover, the watermark retrieval process demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a normalized correlation of 1 and a bit error rate of 0 under no-attack conditions, ensuring accurate and reliable watermark extraction. Notably, the proposed model exhibits robustness against signal processing attacks and noise addition, confirming its efficacy in various scenarios and resilience against potential threats. © 2023 IEEE."

This insufficient blood flow results in damage to the heart muscle, potentially causing cell death and a loss of proper functionality. Damage or death of heart muscle tissue causes changes to the normal heart conduction system resulting in arrhythmias that can be life threatening and cause the heart to stop suddenly. So the most effective technology used to diagnose MI is by reading the patient's Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal or performing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) tests. Currently, many studies have proposed MRI-based MI detection methods. In general, the method used for MI detection is localization heart, motion field estimation, preprocessing, and classification. From the many studies of MI detection with MRI, the accuracy value is still low compared to MI detection with ECG. This is because the classification algorithm used can still make the detection accuracy low. So in this study, MI detection with MRI will use a CNN algorithm. To solve the existing problems, this final project proposes the development of Deep Learning which is a CNN algorithm, that supports the improvement of MI detection accuracy. Last but not least, this final project also analyzes the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The MRI data contains only 100 images so do Data Augmented for getting more data.

Often, most nutritional studies focus on the edible prawn parts, rather than the prawn discarded components. The nutritional evaluation of different prawn parts can provide insights into the nutrient composition and guiding for the development of value-added products. Three groups of prawn samples were collected from 3 different ponds, representing different prawn sizes. The water quality analysis of each pond was also conducted to determine the extent to which it can affect the nutritional composition. The conventional and biochemical analytical method were used to establish the proximate nutritional quality (ash, moisture, protein, fats and carbohydrate) of different prawn components: meat, head, shell and cheliped. The ash and protein content were recorded the highest in the shell (28.9 ± 0.36 % and 6.95 ± 0.06 %, respectively) and chelipeds (30.8 ± 0.52 % and 4.45 ± 0.44 %, respectively) parts of prawn. This can imply that both prawn shells and chelipeds have the potential to be used to create novel value-added products. Relative to the size, the meat component of smaller-sized prawns has higher protein content at 3.78 ± 0.02 % when compared with the larger-sized samples of 0.84 ± 0.03 %. This might have attributed to the difference of stage growth and the prawn feed. Alternatively, no significant correlation was observed between the water quality and the nutritional quality of M. rosenbergii of all sizes, inferring that there is no relation between the water quality and nutritional quality of the prawn. © 2023 University of Brunei Darussalam.

Many studies have made predictions about ocean waves using statistical methods, conventional machine learning, and advanced neural networks. However, because there are certain limitations, such as statistical methods, which have limitations in their ability to capture non-stationary and non-linear data; an advanced model is needed to model accurately the nonlinear behaviour of wave data. This study uses a deep learning model, i.e. to make predictions of significant wave height using the GRU with Attention mechanism. The Attention mechanism is added, to increase prediction accuracy, since it can remember which data points significantly influence predicting future data. As a case study, we chose an area in the Java Sea, Indonesia, i.e., Jakarta Bay. We use hourly wave data collected from ERA5, in the period from January 2018 to December 2020.

This tendency has heightened global competition and demanded firms' regional development for their continued viability. For these criteria to be met, it is required to efficiently employ resources in pursuit of operational excellence. In the context of cloud computing (CC), task scheduling is a key research topic. Task scheduling is an approach that employs an efficient algorithm to map client tasks to appropriate and accessible virtualized resources. Since CC is a distributed and scalable realm, it is more difficult to schedule work. Therefore, an effective approach to work scheduling is required since it is regarded as vital for system performance. Traditional algorithms including round-robin (RR), first come first serve (FCFS), largest job first (LJF), and shortest job first (SJF). To enhance the RR algorithm, several researchers have concentrated on choosing a suitable quantum time and provided a variety of approaches. Several researchers use Cloudsim to model CC infrastructure and applications. This review is intended to explore further because there are still many problems that will be corrected and resolved in further research. This paper can be a valuable resource for researchers who want to improve or develop RR or implement it in CC or various other related fields.  © 2023 IEEE."

In light of this, efficient methods for detecting alcohol-related disorders are essential for early intervention and effective treatment. This study proposes a feature extraction technique using GLCM (Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix) texture analysis to classify normal and alcoholic EEG signals. The process involves forming a matrix of 64 signal channels from EEG data, and GLCM features such as ASM, IDM, Correlation, Contrast, Variance, and entropy are extracted at different angles. The study achieves a 70% accuracy using Random Forest with all features and directions.

Customers, with their unique preferences, often rely on previous customer reviews when selecting a suitable hotel. Therefore, personalization can simplify this process by providing curated lists of hotel recommendations. Our research analyzed six hotel aspects: Value, Accessibility, Service, Room, Cleanliness, and Sleep Quality. We utilize transformer-based NLP models, namely BERT and RoBERTa, to accomplish the analysis. We propose a review classification method to identify customer preferences for each aspect and create a review-based recommendation system for hotel suggestions. To assess performance, we utilize three randomly selected reviews as inputs for both the classification model and the recommendation system. Our findings demonstrate that BERT outperformed RoBERTa in review classification, achieving an accuracy score of 0.8963 and a macro F1 score of 0.83. On the other hand, when constructing a review-based recommendation, RoBERTa proved superior to BERT, with the highest cosine similarity score of 0.99917.

The antenna, whose patch shape is bounded by a spline curve formed from symmetrical cycles of 14 control knots, was initially oval. Using CMA-ES, each knot's position is then translated in the x-, y-, and its combined axis direction to get an improved bandwidth response due to changes in the patch shape resulting from the spline generation. By simulation, the shifting scenarios succeed in widening the antenna's bandwidth. Furthermore, the antenna with the best bandwidth response of the three scenarios is fabricated and validated through measurement. The simulation shows that the antenna works in the range of 2.9 to 20 GHz, with a geometrical bandwidth of 224.5 %, while the measurement results show that the antenna works from 3.7 to 20 GHz or a geometrical bandwidth of 189.5 %.

This paper explores the application of machine learning, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) method, in predicting the location of oil leaks in a pipeline, given the outlet pressure of the pipe and the expected leak rate. Due to very low number of leak occasion in the real practical case, it is quite challenging to obtain enough balanced leak data to train the learning model properly. To manage that issue, we generate the data manually by simulating the leak process using Beggs-Brill pressure drop correlation in various combination of different experimental cases.

Furthermore, the recommender system plays an important role to make it easier for users to find games that match their preferences. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a widely used and successful recommender paradigm. CF provides recommendations based on the similarity of preferences of other users. This paradigm can be divided into two categories such as memory-based CF and model-based CF. Model-based CF uses machine learning techniques such as matrix factorization (MF). Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is one of the most relevant techniques for MF and can handle sparsity problems.

The polarization loss factor will reduce the received power level. It will also affect the channel capacity of the system. In MIMO antennas, the depolarization effect does not only occur in one element or one channel. This significantly reduces the received power based on the number of MIMO elements.

Accurate forecasting of SPP can increase the efficiency of electricity generators and reduce high operational costs. One of the main challenges in forecasting Solar Electricity Production lies in selecting the appropriate input features in machine learning models. External factors, such as different weather conditions, play an essential role in influencing the availability of electricity at the SPP. This research focuses on determining the proper input features for machine learning-based active power production forecasting in SPP. We use two deep-learning models, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) models, to design active power production in SPP. Other than weather features, we also add a time feature, i.e., hourly time information, which can improve the accuracy of SPP forecasting. The results of this research show that selecting the proper weather features and adding time features can increase the model's accuracy in forecasting active power production. The LSTM produced the best model with an R-squared of 0.842 and an RMSE of 34.122 for a one-month prediction.

The transmission coefficient of two antennas obtained from the data acquisition process are used for processing the image reconstruction. The selected method for image reconstruction is using compressive sensing which considers the variation in transmission signal strength. In order to carry out the process, the object of tree trunk is positioned between two antennas. A parallel beam setup recognizes the object with 72 projections produced by an angular rotation of 5 degrees for 360 degrees. Two transmission coefficient data are obtained by utilizing dual polarized feature of QRHA, namely vertical polarization and horizontal polarization.

Environmental changes are observed in areas that become training data representing geothermal areas, namely Sarulla Geothermal and areas representing non-geothermal areas, namely Bangka Belitung. Classification of potential geothermal environmental hazards was done using machine learning by taking data on these parameters in the test data area representing other geothermal areas, namely Kamojang Geothermal and other non-geothermal areas, namely East Kalimantan. The five machine learning algorithms used are algorithms on the classification problem boundary that have been selected from various classification algorithms. Taking these five algorithms is expected to add a strong reason for the classification accuracy, where the accuracy generated from the five tends to be high. That is, the resulting accuracy is above 80% on average, with the Decision Tree algorithm as the best algorithm in this study, with an accuracy of 96%.

Nevertheless, the per-packet detection model is not scalable for high-speed networks due to the sheer number of packet detections per second. Recent studies show that network flow-based detection has better scalability and applicability for network layer protection. However, the existing flow-based datasets are impractical since they require packet logging and post-processing for feature extraction. This study proposed a dataset converter that generates a flow-based dataset based on existing per-packet-based log data using the OpenFlow switch and SDN controllers. It serves as proof of compatibility and practicability that the trained model can be directly implemented on real switches, particularly the SDN switch. The proposed dataset converter can work in an asynchronous mode that precisely converts the dataset regardless of the original speed of the network log data. The test results on a slow DDoS attack dataset show that the converter can generate flow-based datasets with smaller data sizes and better insight regarding the attack pattern. © 2023 IEEE."

On the other hand, existing research mentioned that user comfort metrics in smart lighting are still limited. The aim of our study is a proposed novel technology acceptance model (TAM) called smart lighting TAM (SLTAM), which can measure user comfort and smart lighting technology acceptance. We formed SLTAM by conducting exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The first step of our research was to develop a basic TAM construct containing user comfort and then run a survey. The next step is to carry out EFA, which involves several tests, such as Bartlett's test of sphericity, Scree plot analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The test results show that, through Scree plot analysis, four latent factors exist in our TAM model. We named these latent factors: comfort, perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived efficiency (PE), and behavioral intention (BI). Through structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, our measurements show that comfort correlates with PE with a significance value of <0.01. PE correlates with PEOU and BI with a significance value of <0.01. Finally, PEOU correlates with BI with a significance value of 0.03.

The results demonstrated that 64 flows in a topology with four servers attained the optimal equilibrium between maintaining response time stability and optimizing load balancing efficiency. Furthermore, the performance evaluation test with four servers reached equilibrium with an average response time of 0.035 seconds.

We pre-processed the dataset, among others, by applying a mean decrease in impurity (MDI) feature selection. We then implemented and compared three advanced anomaly detection methods from the last three years: one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), local outlier factor (LOF), and isolation forest (iForest). We use several metrics for the comparison, namely the receiver operating curve (ROC), the area under the curve (AUC), geometrical mean (G-Mean), sensitivity, and specificity.

We use the Doppler spread compensator (DSC) technique and combine it with a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO-DSC) system to compensate for the Doppler effects and to obtain a higher capacity. We perform a series of computer simulations to evaluate the dominance of either Rayleigh fading or Doppler effects on the error-floor of the 5G&B high-speed railway system. The results show that the domination of Rayleigh fading and the Doppler effects depends on the number of antenna elements. When the number of antenna elements is large, Rayleigh fading dominates; however, when the number of antenna elements is small, the Doppler effect dominates causing worse bit-error-rate (BER) performances.

In manual coffee roasters, this causes inconsistency, because it really depends on the ability and experience of the coffee bean roaster. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a machine learning-based preliminary study to detect the cracking sound of coffee beans.

Is-OWC has advantages such as low power consumption and high data rates. However, the Is-OWC system has challenges, such as the influence of the pointing error angle parameters on the transmitter and receiver satellites, the wavelength used, and the distance of optical wireless. Apart from that, multiplexing techniques are one way to improve the performance of the IS-OWC system in terms of bandwidth and data rate, such as the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique.

Urban problem detection is a process to classify images reported in an application to be followed up by the Government. The detection is crucial for maintaining livable and sustainable cities. However, annotating large-scale datasets for object detection models is labor-intensive. This paper proposes a few-shot object detection model for urban problem detection, overcoming data limitations. Our model demonstrates promising performance across 13 selected categories, including 10 base classes and 3 novel classes, using a dataset from the Jakarta Kini (JAKI) application. We evaluate the model on familiar (base classes) and unseen (novel classes) categories, showcasing its generalization capabilities. With increased instances (n-shot), our model achieves high average precision (AP) scores, with the highest performance observed at 30-shot. The validation evaluation yields AP scores of 54.5% for all classes, 65.3% for base classes, and 71.6% for novel classes. Similarly, the test evaluation results in AP scores of 42.5% for all classes, 51.4% for base classes, and 69.8% for novel classes. The performance differences between the validation and test datasets stem from unique features and category challenges. Our few-shot object detection model holds promise for real-world urban problem detection and can be extended to other urban-related tasks and datasets.  © 2023 IEEE."

This study also demonstrates that the Doppler shift in the HST channel varies based on the speed scenario and the number of scatterers present, with the higher the frequency and speed resulting in a greater Doppler shift.

In the academic domain, automatic keyword extraction simplifies the process of finding and categorizing scientific publications, enabling paper repositories to optimize their IR and document organizing systems.

This paper thoroughly examines how Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology was used to build and apply a channel sounder in an indoor setting. The goal is to record the features of multipath fading and figure out how different indoor propagation effects affect wireless communication systems. The proposed channel sounder takes advantage of SDR's flexibility and ability to be programmed to send and receive signals efficiently and to use advanced signal processing methods to estimate the channel. By taking advantage of the broad nature of the signal being transmitted, the channel sounder can record the time-varying impulse response of the channel, including the multipath components and fading that comes with them. The results show that the channel sounder can correctly describe the indoor radio channel and give important information about how to design and improve wireless communication systems inside.

IRS utilizes planar surfaces with passive reflecting elements to induce amplitude and phase changes in incident signals, revolutionizing wireless channel reconfiguration. By flexibly reconfiguring signal propagation, IRS holds promise in addressing channel fading and interference issues, thereby boosting wireless communication capacity and reliability. Vehicular Communication, on the other hand, establishes a computer network in which vehicles and roadside units act as communication nodes, sharing safety warnings and traffic information. V2V, V2I, and V2X technologies enable effective communication between vehicles and infrastructure, aiming to improve road safety and enhance integration between diverse services.

Hybrid learning, which combines face-to-face and online learning, is gaining popularity due to advances in technology. In this study, six variables were studied: digital literacy, academic mindset, cognitive engagement, time management, attributes, and interactive features. In addition, these variables are evaluated based on the level of student satisfaction. Using a Likert scale questionnaire, data were collected from 40 students at a private university in West Java, Indonesia. To find out the average score of each variable, a descriptive analysis was performed. According to the descriptive analysis, students have good digital literacy and a positive academic outlook. Cognitive engagement, on the other hand, is rated low and requires more learning. There is room for improvement in the quality of learning attributes and learning interactivity. Interestingly, students demonstrated their ability to manage time well. These findings indicate that, although student satisfaction with hybrid learning is still neutral, institutions can improve elements that can affect student satisfaction. Universities must concentrate on improving the interactive aspects of learning and the quality of learning attributes if they want to improve students' learning experiences. These findings will help refine the hybrid learning approach, which will increase student satisfaction and improve learning effectiveness in the future. © 2023 IEEE."

A recent research study focused on enhancing the responsiveness of these tracker antennas. By manually inputting PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) values for direction control, the study achieved notable improvements.The results demonstrated that by fine-tuning PID values, particularly setting Kp=5, Ki=0.21812, and Kd=12, and targeting an angle of 90°, the response time was reduced to 1.2 seconds with an overshoot of 28.8% and 1.6 seconds of oscillation. This optimized control mechanism significantly improved antenna direction accuracy, aligning it with the desired setpoint. Furthermore, the importance of antenna alignment and polarization matching in communication systems was emphasized. Ensuring alignment between the receiving antenna's polarization and the incoming wave polarization is crucial for maintaining a strong signal reception power level. This alignment enables accurate tracking of antenna positions, supporting real-time GPS data communication.

The objective of this paper is to provide a path planning using the bee colony algorithm to find the best routes for a coffee plantation. There are several monitoring techniques for coffee, one of which is using a drone equipped with image processing. In this research, path planning was carried out to determine the fastest route that a drone can take using the bee colony algorithm. The path planning was divided into two areas that have been adjusted to the operational capabilities of the DJI Phantom 4 drone type.

We obtained the PM2.5 concentration dataset from Kaggle. The next step is applying the STL to analyze trends and seasonal components in datasets. Then we compared three forecasting models: gated recurrent unit (GRU), long short-term memory (LSTM), and one-dimensional convolutional LSTM (1D Conv-LSTM). We use the mean absolute error (MAE) for model performance comparisons. The STL test results show a trend component in the dataset that can influence forecasting performances. GRU exhibits a better MAE than LSTM, 1D ConvLSTM, and two state-of-the-art method: Stacked LSTM and BiLSTM. GRU's MAE score is 13.9.

The signal comprises a mixture of the FECG, maternal electrocardiogram (MECG), and ambient noise. The central concept involves projecting the signal into higher-dimensional spaces and leveraging the assumption of statistical independence among the constituent components to achieve their separation from the mixture. To accomplish this, singular value decomposition (SVD) is initially applied to the spectrogram, followed by an iterative application of independent component analysis (ICA) on the principal components. The SVD technique contributes to the enhanced separability of each individual component, while ICA facilitates the promotion of statistical independence between the fetal and maternal ECGs. Furthermore, we refine and customize the aforementioned approach specifically for ECG signals by incorporating knowledge of the frequency distribution of the MECG and other inherent ECG characteristics.

Nevertheless, raw EEG signals were prone to noise contamination, such as electromyography artifacts from muscle movements and electrooculography artifacts from eye blinking, which could adversely impact signal analysis. To overcome this challenge, we employed pre-processing techniques involving fourth-order Butterworth filters and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to reject and reduce noise from the EEG data.

In addition to the sources of emissions, the mass concentration of PM2.5 may be impacted by meteorological factors such as temperature, humidity levels, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, and the speed/direction of the wind. A previous study established a monitoring system for air quality at Tokong Nanas (GKU) and the Deli Building of Telkom University, located in Bandung, using microsensor technology. Various forecasting techniques were also employed to predict the mass concentration of PM2.5, considering its meteorological factors. However, the study found that not all the meteorological parameters give significant results in PM2.5 forecasting, with an RMSE value of 27 μg/m3. Hence, this study optimized the forecasting system of PM2.5 mass concentration using the Artificial Neural Network Backpropagation method. Only a few meteorological parameters were taken into consider-ation in the forecasting system, which has a significant impact on the forecast quality, such as rainfall intensity, relative humidity, and wind speed. As a result, the Tokong Nanas (GKU) has the best network model for 4-9-12-9-1 architecture with a learning value of 0.2, whereas the Deli Building is 4-20-9-9-1 with a 0.3 value. The RMSE and MAPE performances generated by GKU and Deli best network models were 8 μg/m3 at 37% and 13 μg/m3 at 15%, respectively.

Historically, Islamic medicine practitioners were restricted to Islamic communities and had a profound grasp of religion. Persons with higher levels of education and social position are currently the most frequent users of Islam-based medicine. Hijrah medication is crucial for achieving holistic health and keeping good health with natural human defenses against illnesses that are carried out holistically and trusted by the users. The decision to treat according to Islam was made because the Muslim community was aware of the necessity and was committed to reviving the Prophetic thibbun medicine that the Prophet Muhammad SAW had gained thousands of years prior. The purpose of this article is to identify the motivations behind people’s decisions to diagnose, treat, and heal illnesses using “hijrah medicine” based on Islamic teachings. Medical care is something that everyone, especially Muslims, should consider when they are sick in order to recover and always get closer to Allah SWT. The approach used was a qualitative literature study with a health anthropology viewpoint and practical theory drawn from a literature review of earlier research relevant to this topic. The results of this study demonstrate that faith-based therapy typically has no side effects, and individuals prefer it because of its high level of trustworthiness and negligible adverse effects. Additionally, the price is acceptable when weighed against the price of medicines. The people who preceded them used Islamic alternative medicine, using herbal remedies like honey, habbatussauda, olive oil, cupping, and ruqyah to alleviate diseases. This study’s conclusion is that practicing “hijrah medicine” medical care based on Islamic principles can be effective in curing diseases. © Mattioli 1885. All Rights Reserved."

The 5G NR network planning in this study was carried out in 7 sub-districts located in the central area of Bandung City where there is no 5G network covering the entire area in this area. Communities in 7 sub-districts with a total population of 418,264 people have very high activity and mobility which must be supported by adequate cellular network infrastructure. In addition, the selection of these 7 sub-districts is because these sub-districts are tourist areas that are visited by many local and international tourists. Based on the results of calculating the capacity and coverage of the 5G NR network, 10 sites are needed to cover the area. Furthermore, planning simulations were carried out using simulation software and obtained an average SS-RSRP value of -81.22 dBm, an average SS-SINR value of 13.03 dB, and a data rate of 125.53 Mbps. The results of these three parameters have met the operator KPI standards and it can be concluded that the 5G NR network planning in 7 sub-districts in the center of Bandung City has been successful.  © 2023 IEEE."

This research investigates the factors influencing the adoption of the agricultural extension application 'Buruan Sae' in Bandung City, utilizing the UTAUT model. The study collected data from 14 agricultural extension agents working under the Department of Food Security and Agriculture. The analysis identified trust and performance expectancy as the key determinants of adoption, complemented by attitude and dependence. The study investigated the impact of different factors on users' intention to use the 'Buruan Sae' app. The study investigated the impact of UTAUT variables on Behavioral Intention towards the 'Buruan Sae' app. Four out of five variables (Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Facilitating Conditions, and Perceived Technology) positively influenced Behavioral Intention, while Performance Expectancy had a weaker impact. The Performance Expectancy's regression coefficient was 0.410 with a significance level of 0.000 $( < 0.05)$, leading to the acceptance of Hypothesis 1. The same holds true for Effort Expectancy and Social Influence with t-values of 6.013 and 3.668, respectively, both significant at sig $< 0.05$, confirming Hypotheses 2 and 3. Facilitating Conditions' influence on Perceived Technology was established with a t-value of 5.425 and sig $< 0.05$, accepting Hypothesis 4.

It delineates the developmental stages into three components aligned with Berger and Luckmann’s social construction theory: externalisation, objectification, and internalisation. Using qualitative methods and field studies, data were gathered through semi-structured interviews with three religious leaders from two eco-pesantren in Banten Province. Externalization is exemplified by the kyai’s teachings on humanity as caliphs, advocating against harming the Earth, emphasizing cleanliness as integral to faith, and prioritising ṭahhārah in fiqh. Objectification is seen in the prohibition of deforestation and embedded environmental preservation duties within the schools’ hidden curriculum. Internalisation reflects practical implementation aligned with established objectives, observed through growing pro-environmental consciousness, attitudes, and behaviours among school members, evolving progressively. This construction of ecological devotion resulted in tangible contributions to groundwater conservation and flood risk mitigation by the two schools. The findings highlight Islamic boarding schools’ potential to elevate environmental standards via fiqh al-bī’ah-rooted ecological wisdom. Collaborative efforts involving stakeholders, such as financial support and training programmes, are vital to enhancing the environmental management capacity, particularly in establishing impactful water management systems within these institutions.

Peneliti memilah proses konstruksi menjadi tiga komponen sesuai dengan teori konstruksi sosial realitas dari Berger dan Luckmann, yaitu eksternalisasi, objektivikasi, dan internalisasi. Penelitian ini didesain menggunakan metode kualitatif dengan pendekatan studi lapangan. Data penelitian didapatkan dengan wawancara semi terstruktur dengan tiga tokoh agama di dua eko-pesantren di Provinsi Banten. Eksternalisasi diketahui muncul dalam bentuk penafsiran para kyai terhadap peran manusia sebagai khalīfah dan larangan berbuat kerusakan di muka Bumi, adagium bahwa kebersihan adalah sebagian dari iman, dan penempatan ṭahhārah sebagai bagian awal untuk memasuki fiqh. Adapun bentuk objektivikasi adalah larangan menebang pohon dan kewajiban-kewajiban yang terarah pada upaya memelihara lingkungan hidup di pesantren yang diprogram sebagai kurikulum tersembunyi di pesantren. Internalisasi yang terjadi merupakan praktik nyata di lapangan yang sesuai dengan objektivikasi yang telah dibuat dan dijadwalkan. Internalisasi ditunjukkan dengan kesadaran, sikap, dan perilaku yang pro-lingkungan pada hampir semua orang di dalam pesantren dan berlangsung secara progresif seiring waktu. Dampak yang lebih luas dari proses konstruksi kesalehan ekologis ini adalah kontribusi nyata kedua pesantren dalam konservasi air tanah maupun mitigasi risiko banjir. Temuan penelitian ini mengindikasikan bahwa pesantren dapat berpartisipasi dalam meningkatkan kualitas lingkungan hidup lewat konstruksi kearifan ekologis berbasis fiqh al-bī’ah.

To address this challenge, we propose harnessing the power of neural networks and IoT methods to predict temperature and humidity at different heights within TULT buildings. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) serves as an information processing system, emulating the cognitive functions of the human brain and making informed decisions based on previously studied data. Complementing this, the Internet of Things (IoT) represents the integration of the internet, mobile computing, and seamless connectivity into our everyday lives. IoT embodies a shift from the traditional Internet of People to the Internet of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interactions, often referred to as the 'Disruption of Things' (DoT). By integrating ANN with IoT, our approach demonstrates a remarkable temperature prediction accuracy, achieving an impressive Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value of 0.963. This advanced predictive capability holds significant promise in optimizing the learning environment's comfort and ensuring a conducive atmosphere for both students and educators.  © 2023 IEEE."

By using LoRa technology, this system can be placed in areas that are difficult to reach by cellular networks. Some of the critical components of the designed system include motion detection sensors, microcontrollers thatfunction as data processing engines, and LoRa modules that function as data transmission media. The motion detection sensor detects movement around the target. The sensor sendsdata to the microcontroller for processing after detecting motion. The microcontroller then processes the data from thesensor and sends it through the LoRa module to the receivingnode connected to the network. Both nodes and microcontrollers can serve as data collection centers andprovide notifications if suspicious movement is detected.

Due to the low computational resources of IoT devices, common security measures in computer systems can potentially degrade the performance of IoT devices. This research aims to provide a QR-code and MQTT-based authentication scheme for connecting users with intended IoT-based mechanical relay devices. In this scheme, IoT-based mechanical relay devices are by default connected with the IoT systems by using MQTT communication protocol with certain topics. Then, users have to be authenticated by the MQTT broker to connect with the IoT devices. The authentication process uses QR codes to transfer credentials from the IoT devices to the users' mobile applications. After entering the correct username and password combined with the credentials generated from the QR codes, users eventually can access IoT-based mechanical relay devices. The QR code implementation successfully simplifies IoT device onboarding, while the use of AES 256 encryption strengthens security. The performance measurements on Android devices indicate high efficiency, and QR code testing demonstrates success in various conditions. These findings have the potential to improve the security and efficiency of IoT device usage in diverse contexts. Eventually, this research can deliver one alternative security solution for securing IoT device integration and safeguarding critical operations and data.  © 2023 IEEE."

The proposed modulation scheme is implemented by utilizing a uniform filter bank both at the transmitter and the receiver to provide high modulation performance with improved bandwidth efficiency which is almost required for wireless communication systems. To demonstrate its performance, conventional M-ary PSK and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems are also evaluated and analyzed under Rayleigh distributed frequency selective fading channel and with the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). From the performance result, it is shown that M-ary PSK with the implementation of 64 subcarrier OWDM modulation scheme outperforms the OFDM and the conventional ones where it provides BER performance with the value of 1×10-4 for Eb/N0 of 20 dB.  © 2023 IEEE."

However, the operation of 'My Tuc-Tuc' has faced several challenges, particularly concerning user experiences, especially among drivers. Therefore, this study aims to assess the technology readiness of 'My Tuc-Tuc' users, focusing on their readiness across four personality traits: optimism, innovativeness, anxiety, and insecurity. These traits encompass both positive and negative perspectives. The study employed the Technology Readiness Index (TRI) methodology, a well-established framework for evaluating users' readiness to adopt and utilize technology. The selection of participants involved utilizing the Slovin formula, resulting in a sample size of 12 'My Tuc-Tuc' users who also served as TelU Car drivers. Rigorous validity and reliability tests were conducted to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the collected data. Subsequently, the TRI scores were calculated based on the participants' responses. The findings of the study revealed a TRI score of 3.9098, indicating that 'My Tuc-Tuc' users fall within the high technology readiness category according to the TRI classification. This suggests that these users are well-prepared and receptive to the utilization of the 'My Tuc-Tuc' application-based transportation service. The results provide valuable insights for Telkom University and the 'My Tuc-Tuc' team, enabling them to identify and address the challenges faced by users and develop appropriate strategies to enhance the overall user experience and service quality.

Electromyography devices still do not have direct integration through websites or apps, nor are they capable of storing digital patient records. Instead, data collection is done manually or on-site. However, with the Internet of Things-based muscle signal detection device, this process becomes easier for medical personnel. Medical personnel can check the patient's medical record results through a laptop and save the digital record data. The advantage is that the monitoring process can be done online, so that medical personnel can easily see the patient's progress from day to day through the available digital data records.

And in the gastrocnemius muscle it is 10.685 Volt when the muscle is in extension and 18.028 Volt when the muscle is in flexion.

They are more comfortable at 2.6 GHz, 3.5 GHz, 26 GHz, and 28 GHz, in addition to 700 MHz for the breadth of coverage. The performance of cellular telecommunications services based on 5G technology is possible for new operators, although it will be carried out as stand-alone services. This opportunity will be taken by looking at internet subscriber data/data communication from existing operators as active internet users, which is quite large and has a potential of over 250 million users. There has been no previous study regarding the feasibility of deploying this 5G technology-based Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) Network. Based on the experience of implementing previous generations of telecommunication service technology, the government and operators need to be careful in determining the right moment to deploy this 5G technology service, which is predicted to be able to provide broadband services with streaming capabilities of 10 to 100 times the streaming speed of 4G technology. It should be noted that the lack of success of 3G performances in 2006 from 2G, 2.5G, and 2.75 G. Almost all operators who were expected to be very lucky turned out to be not optimal; even now, only 4 operators are playing on 3G. where they have not been able to force users of the 2G generation to switch to 3G, including in big cities where the performance of the 3G network is not yet optimal and evenly distributed. Still, many areas are blank spots from 3G networks and services. From this experience, scientific studies are needed to ensure the feasibility of the upcoming 5G BWA business and identify business opportunities that can be implemented. The feasibility analysis must be viewed from various aspects, namely aspects of technical readiness, market aspects, and financial aspects in terms of the techno-economics of the operators who will provide 5G telecommunications services by calculating several essential parameters as a measure of business feasibility, namely Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Payback Period (PBP). © 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

This paper analyzed Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) performance within Antares network and proposed a system model as a means to monitor weather conditions in a mobile application. The designed system is expected to have a high level of Quality of Service (QoS) using parameters such as Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), and delay. All of the measurement results including QoS parameters displayed on a mobile application called Wever. Wever visualize the information with informative graphs and a live graph for live measurement feature. Wever is able to display and visualize 100% data accurately which being sent and stored from Antares to Firebase. The performance quality of LoRaWAN Antares is on high performance at 50m distance with RSSI value around - 75.36 dBm for SF 7 and -93.94 dBm for SF 11. The further the distance the greater SF value is needed. SF 11 at 250m distance could transmit 36 out of 40 data in measurement time span. While SF 7 lost about 77.5% data within the time span. Greater SF means greater power consumption and low bit rate. Using an appropriate SF could increase battery life while maintain the system functionality. The SNR value is greater than -18 dB, while Lora could demodulate signal until -20 dB below the noise floor. Overall delay never hit 0.09 ms means the data transmission is nearly instant and consistent. Wever can match up with the transmission speed, simulating the live graph with every change made from the sensors.  © 2023 IEEE."

The web-based application monitoring system is achieved by comparing the monthly fee with the existing monitoring system. To validate the accuracy of Anbu, services in the Kubernetes cluster are tested in two cases using a load test. The first case is to scale the number of replicas set for the service according to CPU and memory. The second is to provide recommendations for the ideal number of CPUs and memory according to the history of their actual use. The results show that scalable startups can do automation monitoring with an Anbu usage fee for 24 hours of uptime of around 200 per month.

The variables affecting online taxi passengers' choice of payment method are frequently difficult for stakeholders to pinpoint. The purpose of this study is to use the random forest algorithm to forecast the preferred payment methods for online taxi users. The random forest approach was chosen due to its ability to handle complex information and generate accurate forecasts. An online taxi-user dataset with the labels 'cash' and 'digital' was employed throughout the model development stage. The random forest model is subsequently trained by taking into account the characteristics that affect the prediction of payment methods, such as income, online taxi brand, credit card, e-wallet, and account ownership. The created predictive model was tested on the dataset using an experiment employing the bootstrapping method after going through the training phase. An accuracy rate of 96% in the experiment demonstrates how well the random forest model predicts the mode of payment for online taxi consumers. In addition, high values of precision, recall, and Fl-score were also obtained, indicating the reliability of the model in correctly classifying payment modes. © 2023 IEEE."

This is because there is no standard used in Indonesia. However, currently many batteries circulating in Indonesia uses a voltage of 72 V with a capacity of 20 Ah. Therefore, this study aims to design a battery pack with a specification of 72 volts with a capacity of 40 Ah. The advantage of the results of the battery pack design in this study is that it has the same dimensions and weight as battery packs on the market but has twice the capacity of 40 Ah so that electric motorbikes can travel farther than those in circulation. Based on the research results of BMS monitoring, it is estimated that charging 100% at a voltage of 70.7 Volts. The difference in voltage in the battery management system and the results of the analysis calculations is caused by variations in the voltage in each battery cell. Technically the difference between each battery cell under 2 Volts will not be a problem as long as the BMS used has an active battery cell voltage balancing feature. In the dyno test results for each additional speed the battery can function properly at any given torque variation.

This condition encourages humans to develop renewable energy sources, one of which is bioethanol, with the availability of abundant raw materials in nature. However, the development of bioethanol is still ineffective because it requires a long time and has high costs. Therefore, a design for bioethanol fabrication from oil palm plantation products with ionic liquid pretreatment using SuperPro Designer (SPD) software was developed. The bioethanol production process was simulated through three stages: pretreatment, enzymatic saccharification, and fermentation. Pretreatment was carried out using the ionic liquid Choline Acetate, after which the results of saccharification and fermentation were analyzed. The results of saccharification showed that around 138 g/L of palm oil was converted into sugar for fermentation. The overall result of the simulation system is that the fermentation process for 12 hours produced 92 g/L ethanol or 96% of the theoretical yield. Meanwhile, ethanol production through fabrication for energy can reduce ethanol prices by 30% from their initial price. This ethanol fabrication design is very supportive of optimizing biomass into bioethanol.

The development of bioethanol production is currently leading to the residue of the main product. So that in this study the biomass of arena or Arenga Pinatta was used with a large availability of waste. Therefore, a performance and economic analysis was carried out in the production of bioethanol from palm biomass with ionic liquid (IL) using SuperPro Designer (SPD) Software. As a preparatory stage, the process of testing the characteristics of the biomass is carried out to obtain the most optimal composition of palm sugar in bioethanol production. After simulating the conditions according to the experimental process on the most optimal palm biomass composition, it was found that the most optimal Ionic Liquid (IL) and biomass ratio was at 0.5 g/g with the ethanol concentration obtained at 90.6 g/L at 13 hours which corresponds to theoretical yield of 96% conversion of biomass to ethanol. Meanwhile, the production of ethanol in a factory for energy can minimize the price of ethanol by 30% from the initial price. Thus, with the abundant availability of biomass, bioethanol production with aren biomass has the potential to be developed in Indonesia. © 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved."

However, rainwater that has been held for more than two months will be hazy and mossy in appearance. Rainwater must, therefore, first be treated to make it clearer. Rainwater was treated using clinoptilolite-type zeolite. We used two sizes of zeolite particles: large (0.02 cm) and small (0.002 cm). The zeolite was activated in an oven at 225 °C for 3 hours. After 50 hours of immersion, it was found that large-sized zeolite could lower the turbidity of rainwater by up to 86.2% without increasing the TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) value. Small-sized zeolite might reduce the turbidity of rainwater by 8% for the same immersion time. These findings show that larger zeolites are more efficient at reducing rainwater turbidity. Large-sized zeolite does not require any further processing to be made smaller before use because it is readily available on the market. Furthermore, it showed that the zeolite-based rainwater treatment process employs the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. © 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved."

For this reason, a comparative study of Ku-band and Ka-band was carried out to ensure that the two frequency bands can be used in Indonesia's tropical climate and further evaluate the existing regulations for the implementation of HTS in Indonesia. The results of this study show that Ku-band and Ka-band can be used for HTS satellites in Indonesia. All communication links tested showed C/N values higher than the minimum requirements of C/N. Although both frequency bands can use in Indonesia, in terms of economy and efficiency, Ka-band is greater than Ku-band, the availability of wide bandwidth makes the throughput produced by Ka-band more than Ku-band. Capacity measurement simulation is also carried out with two frequency reuse schemes where higher throughput is present at 8 spot beams per cluster scheme. The scenario requires at least nine times frequency reuse to cover the entire region of Indonesia with total throughput on Ka-band 123.02 Gbps under normal sky conditions and 55.56 Gbps under rain sky conditions. The regulation review process resulted in suggestions for changes to the bandwidth cost index to be used in setting spectrum prices for the use of HTS. The need for this change is based on the consideration that bandwidth cost index was previously the base price for satellite transponders with a small bandwidth and HTS satellites are sensitive bandwidth technology.  © 2023 IEEE."

Several methods, such as long short-term memory (LSTM), have been used for gesture detection on the dataset. However, there is a research opportunity to provide a learning model that requires less training data. Our research aim is to use PCA-SVM for lightweight hand gesture recognition. The first step of our research is to collect the MNIST Gesture dataset from Kaggle. Then, we do preprocessing and prediction model training. We then compare PCA with the mean decrease in impurity (MDI) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method in their performance to reduce dataset dimensions in the SVM training process. Lastly, we compare our proposed model with two state-of-the-art benchmark models: long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN). The test results show that the optimum number of PCA-SVM principal components in ASL hand gesture recognition is 50. Then, PCA performs better than MDI and LASSO on dimension reduction with an SVM model. Finally, the PCA-SVM model bests LSTM in hand gesture recognition by accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. However, PCA-SVM and CNN both have an accuracy higher than 0.99. On the other hand, PCA-SVM is more lightweight than CNN because it has a shorter training time and testing time, namely 3.5 s and 0.2 s, respectively. © 2023 IEEE."

This study proposes a data mining model aimed at predicting customer behavior, with the processed results utilized as suggestions for improvements and company strategies in customer retention through segmentation and classification. Segmentation and classification involve several variables: Session, Interaction with Application, Actions taken during the interaction, purchasing, claim, and discount. This study employs a clustering technique based on the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) model, which considers factors such as the time since the last visit, the number of visits, and the total amount spent by the customer. The classification algorithm model was evaluated by comparing three classification algorithms: decision tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The decision tree algorithm had the highest accuracy, achieving an impressive 87% accuracy rate in customer classification. Factors influencing customer churn include purchasing behavior, session activity, claim feature utilization, adding products to cart, and discounts. Improving stock management is crucial to prevent stock shortages, likely to cause churn.

This study explores the utilization of LoRaWAN in Pangandaran, a regency in the West Java province of Indonesia. Implementing LoRaWAN in this context has resulted in several benefits, including the ability to monitor and control street lighting in specific areas of Pangandaran and real-time recording of energy consumption. The primary objective of this research is to estimate the number of LoRaWAN gateways required to support smart street lighting in Pangandaran. Two methods are employed: coverage calculation using the free space loss approach and capacity calculation. The coverage calculation suggests a requirement of 34 gateways, whereas the capacity calculation indicates that only two gateways are needed. Based on these findings, it can be inferred that, theoretically, a maximum of 34 gateways would be necessary for smart street lighting in the Pangandaran area. However, further research, including driving tests, is recommended to validate these results for future implementation.

This study aims to examine the impact of using biocomposite bricks on the OTTV value. Additionally, it investigates the effects on various thermal properties of the room, such as humidity, air temperature, operative temperature, and Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT), which serve as indicators for assessing thermal comfort. The findings demonstrate that the use of biocomposite bricks can reduce the OTTV value by approximately 7.9% - 10.2%.

Visible light communication (VLC), utilizing a light-emitting diode (LED) to transmit data and a photodiode to receive it, emerges as one of the solution options for transmitting and receiving data wirelessly due to its speed and much broader spectrum. In this paper, we present a design of a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) as source follower and a non-inverting summing amplifier-based transmitter of a VLC system utilizing off-the-shelf available indoor LED, then experimentally demonstrate the system performance by applying Manchester code to improve DC balance so as the midpoint signal will always have a certain fixed value. Furthermore, the impact of the link distance between the transmitter and the receiver on the performance is investigated by sending 1 Mbps of signal data speed and varying the distance from 50cm to 200cm with an interval of 50cm. The results show that the received encoded signal achieves the DC-balanced data even in a dynamic position and is successfully transmitted at the furthest distance of 200cm.

Activation was carried out using a voltage source of 8 V and 12 V for 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. A salinometer is used to measure changes in seawater salinity after being treated with electrically activated zeolite. The salinity reduction value is expressed in percent reduction (η), which is measured every hour for 24 hours. Zeolite activated at a voltage of 8 V for 15 minutes was able to reduce seawater salinity by up to 5.7%. Zeolite activated at 12 V for 10 minutes was able to reduce salinity by up to 7.2%.

One way to ensure secure access to information or infrastructure is to use a QR Code.

However, the use of the RSA algorithm requires high time complexity. This research improves the previous method by introducing a digital signature applied to QR codes to provide information security for access control systems. With a digital signature, data integrity is guaranteed, and owner authentication can be carried out. The method used for digital signatures is ECDSA which operates with groups of elliptic curves as a calculation basis.

This issue emerges due to irrelevant data and information in one region of Indonesia. The data differences should be carefully solved when implementing the PPKM policy. Besides, the PPKM must also pay attention to some specific factors related to the real conditions of a region, such as the data on the epidemiology of COVID-19, economic situations, and population mobility. These three are called Multi Factors. Then, based on the data, COVID-19 has a specific spreading period that cannot be repeated and thus is called temporal. Therefore, using the Multi-Temporal Factors approach to identify their correlation with the PPKM policy by applying Machine Learning, such as the Multiple Linear Regression model and Dynamic Factors, is essential. This research aims to analyze the characteristics and correlations of the COVID-19 pandemic data and the effectiveness of the government's policy on community activities (PPKM) based on the data quality. The results show that the accuracy of the multiple linear regression models is 84%. The Dynamic Factor shows that the five most important factors are idr_close, positive, retail_recreation, station, and healing.

However, low financial literacy is one of the factors that trigger these financial problems. Financial literacy itself refers to the ability of individuals to understand and manage personal finances well. In that context, this thesis aims to examine the influence of family socioeconomic status (X), education level (W), and gender (Z) on the financial literacy (Y) of the community in Tanah Datar Regency. This study used quantitative methods using questionnaires as data collection instruments. Data obtained from 200 respondents in Tanah Datar District were analyzed using the Hayes Process Models regression analysis technique to examine the relationship between independent variables (family socioeconomic status) and moderator variables (education level and gender) with dependent variables (financial literacy). The effect of income, employment, asset ownership, education level, and gender on people's financial literacy levels was examined separately and together. The results showed that simultaneously, socioeconomic status and education level had a positive and significant effect on financial literacy. However, there was no significant effect of gender factors on financial literacy. Therefore, it can be concluded that family socioeconomic status and education level have a positive and significant relationship with the financial literacy of the people in Tanah Datar Regency. These factors can be used as guidelines in designing educational programs and policies that aim to improve financial literacy in the community. In addition, it is important to realize that gender differences do not have a significant impact on financial literacy, so efforts to improve financial literacy must involve all members of society regardless of gender. Therefore, an inclusive approach is needed in an effort to improve financial literacy, so that all people can understand and manage their personal finances well. That way, it is hoped that people can overcome the financial problems they face, and ultimately have a better financial condition. © 2023 SPIE."

However, there are still many vehicles that use the shoulder unwisely, such as using it to pass other vehicles or stopping or resting for a long time. This can cause accidents and commotion. Based on the problem, the Cascade R-CNN algorithm is applied which can be used as an algorithm to detect violations on the toll road shoulder. Cascade R-CNN has multistage detection which can reduce overfitting due to lack of dataset. Cascade R-CNN has multistage detection consisting of three stages.

Among several well-known communication protocols, the MQTT is considered as the most lightweight communication protocol for IoT devices. In addition, the MQTT communication protocol can also provide privacy protection due to the existence of the broker connecting publishers and subscribers in an anonymized way without exposing their addresses. However, this anonymity property can lead to Sybil attacks, including message falsification, replay attack, and impersonation attacks to the IoT systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a SibProMQTT scheme that can make the MQTT communication protocol resist against those issues. The SibProMQTT works by using a timestamp and unique session key on each data transmission and eventually encrypting the MQTT payload for avoiding data theft. The experimental results show that our proposed scheme only induces small computational cost addition which is insignificant for the IoT devices. Moreover, security analyses demonstrate that the SibProMQTT can effectively protect the MQTT communication against Sybil attacks as long as the private key cannot be obtained by attackers. © 2023 IEEE."

We apply association rule analysis to uncover frequent itemsets and association rules, which reveal patterns of correlated purchases among different products. This analysis enables us to identify significant associations, such as the relationship between eggs and instant noodles, and provides valuable insights into consumer purchase behavior. In addition, we employ K-Medoids clustering to group consumers based on their purchasing characteristics. By clustering consumers with similar preferences, we can identify distinct customer segments and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. This clustering approach enhances our understanding of customer behavior by grouping individuals who exhibit similar purchasing patterns and preferences.

Research and efforts to prevent forest fires with early detection systems have become the main focus lately. Early detection of forest fires requires real-time and accurate performance to extinguish the fire immediately. An accurate Artificial Intelligence method for detection is using deep learning. However, the drawback of deep learning is the long inference process due to the large size of the model. The dataset that we use in this research consists of two classes: the fire class and the non-fire class. In this research, we propose using quantization to shrink deep learning models. We use quantization to convert floating point 32-bit to 16-bit. The deep learning model that we use is the CNN DenseNet-121 model. The quantization results on the deep learning model show that the values for macro precision, macro recall, macro F1, and accuracy have not changed from the original deep learning, namely 0.99, 0.99, 0.99, and 0.99. The size of the deep learning model has decreased from 28.2 MB to 13.7 MB. It affects the inference model time, which is 36 times faster using quantization of deep learning than the original deep learning model. The speed of inference model quantization reaches 0.062 s per image. Through these results, the quantization result in the deep learning model can run in real-time and accurately. © 2023 IEEE."

There are only a few surviving copies of similar Bugis maps, all confiscated from local ""pirates"" during the colonial era. While graphical elements of the map undoubtedly point to prototypical European maps, careful analysis of its annotations reveals extensive linguistic modification better to reflect Bugis maritime knowledge. Not only are they completely written in Lontara', the indigenous script of the Bugis, Euro-centric toponyms from contemporaneous maps are consistently replaced by locally derived toponyms from an oral and written tradition unknown to Europeans. In colonial frameworks, maps could be used as powerful instruments of control which eroded indigenous spatial knowledge. As part of an ongoing efforts to decolonize our understanding of maps, critique of western maps should be complemented by discussions of non-western maps which foreground indigenous knowledge or counter-mapping elements. The use of indigenous elements can be regarded as a fascinating case of counter-mapping and a decolonial effort initiated by the anonymous, everyday people of Nusantara. © 2023 Brill Academic Publishers.

Hence, it is imperative for both theoretical and empirical studies to contribute towards enhancing our comprehension of the strategy, implementation, and utilization of information systems in the specific context of nonprofit organizations. The investigation of information systems within the context of non-profit organizations offers a promising avenue for advancing the field of information systems research. This study focuses on the development of an information systems framework using the soft systems methodology, which has already been established. One opportunity for the advancement of information systems in non-profit organizations lies in the establishment of a comprehensive framework that facilitates adoption and is accompanied by robust data governance. This framework enables the analysis of data and the generation of valuable insights, thereby contributing to the development of information systems in the non-profit sector. The choice of data governance was informed by Zhang's (2010) research, which demonstrated that non-profit organizations face significant obstacles in the form of privacy and data security concerns. Furthermore, it is apparent that the preservation of data privacy plays a crucial role in the acceptance and utilization of information systems within non-profit entities. This research aims to contribute to the resolution of the issue by establishing a governance framework for information systems that effectively communicates to users the absence of data privacy risks associated with the systems employed by organizations. The objective of this study is to create a data governance model that will fill the research gap mentioned earlier and make a valuable contribution to the field of information systems research.

The proposed phase shifter is composed of three microstrip line sections and four loading varactor diodes controlled by a single direct current (DC) voltage line. For practical application, the parameters of the varactor diode, such as junction capacitance, series resistance, parasitic inductance, and parasitic capacitance, are considered in the design. The prototype is then realized on a 0.8 mm thick FR4 epoxy dielectric substrate and experimentally measured to verify the design concept. The characterization shows that the measured results agree with the simulated ones. When the DC bias voltages are varied from 1 V to 9 V, a phase shift range of about 25° to 75° can be obtained. The return loss of better than 10 dB and the insertion loss variation of less than 3 dB are achieved over a 1.6 GHz bandwidth.  © 2023 IEEE."

This endeavor is empowered by the role of text analysis, a tool that adeptly uncovers intricate data relationships and contextual intricacies. This is especially pertinent given the textual attributes of System Requirements Specification (SRS) information. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) adds depth to comprehension by converting images into text. However, challenges surface due to variances between functional requirements and the design's control and affordance components, arising from divergent interpretations of functional requirements during elicitation. Our focal point resides in crafting an application to evaluate the alignment between UI design and the textual core of functional requirements. This study reveals 13 Functional Requirements (d1-d13) and categorizes two control/affordance component documents (d14-d15). The integration of text analysis, steered by word2vec, drives an alignment process, culminating in a notable 0.397 score.

In order to create effective educational methods as institutions prepare for the post-pandemic period, it is essential to understand students' preferences for various learning modes. With the aid of machine learning techniques, this study seeks to forecast preferences for learning styles in post-pandemic higher education. The study made use of a dataset compiled from a wide range of college students, which included information on the institution type (public or private), program type (bachelor's or diploma), academic discipline (science or humanities), gender, year of study, internet use, communication costs, comorbidity status, vaccination history, gadget and laptop ownership, and preferred learning mode (online, in-person, or both). For the aim of prediction, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used. Its kernel functions included linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid. Performance criteria like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to assess the models after the dataset was randomly partitioned into training and testing sets. The findings showed that for identifying the preferred mode of learning, SVM with the RBF kernel had the highest prediction accuracy (91.67%). Further proving the RBF kernel's efficacy, the confusion matrix analysis showed that high values in the diagonal represented accurate predictions for each of the three classes (both online and onsite). The results imply that machine learning approaches, in particular SVM with the RBF kernel, may accurately forecast students' preferences for learning modes in the post-pandemic situation.

Fraudulent activities occur when cards are stolen or when unauthorized individuals exploit credit card information. To address this problem, a credit card fraud detection system with high accuracy is developed using the Decision Tree algorithm. The main focus of this study is to address data imbalance and identify the most influential features using the ExtraTreeClassifier algorithm. Additionally, a combination of Decision Tree and AdaBoost is employed to enhance the accuracy of fraud detection. The effectiveness of these algorithms is measured through the use of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The algorithms' effectiveness is further assessed through the examination of ROC AUC curves. Through the process of comparing the performance of the Decision Tree and the combined approach with AdaBoost, we can determine the most effective method for detecting fraudulent activities based on the algorithm that demonstrates the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This comparison allows us to identify the optimal model for effectively identifying and preventing fraudulent activities in various domains, providing valuable insights to mitigate potential threats. © 2023 IEEE."

Dividend announcements are the basis for investors to make investment decisions, as they contain asymmetric information about company performance. However, during the dividend period stock prices often fluctuate, which can make it difficult for investors to make decisions. Therefore, market participants can use sentiment analysis to assess company performance and assist in making investment decisions. The purpose of this study is to analyse headline sentiment during the dividend period, and how it relates to the stock returns of companies included in the LQ45 Index from 2018 to 2022. In conducting the sentiment analysis, the FinBERT model was used to classify dividend news headlines into positive, negative, and neutral sentiment. Then, a Spearman rank correlation test is conducted with the closing price of the stock to see the relationship. The results show that the sentiment formed by news headlines is dominated by neutral sentiment (46%), followed by positive sentiment (28%) and negative sentiment (26%). The study, conducted over the 2018-2022 dividend period, shows a positive relationship between news headlines and stock returns.

In contrast to previous deep learning research, this study employs a transfer learning algorithm as a classifier for MI feature datasets. Feature extraction is performed in segments to obtain more accurate MI features. Six feature extraction methods and transfer learning models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using the VGG-16 architecture were selected as the primary components for MI identification. Additionally, this study compares these models with other CNN transfer learning models, such as VGG-19 and Xception, to assess their performance. Two experimental scenarios were conducted to evaluate MIDs performance in MI detection: experiments without hyperparameter tuning and with hyperparameter tuning. The results indicate that MIDs with CNN (VGG-16) after tuning exhibited the highest detection performance compared to other transfer learning CNN models, both with and without tuning. The accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of MIDS detection with this configuration were 96.7%, 96.0%, and 97.4%, respectively. This research contributes to the development of an enhanced MI detection technique based on PCG signals using a transfer learning CNN.  © 2013 IEEE."

In Indonesia, however, many museums still rely on passive displays, leading to decreased visitor numbers. To address this issue, the study explores the use of scenography, a technique borrowed from theater, to create immersive exhibition experiences. The study analyzes the exhibition ""Para Sekutu yang Tidak bisa Berkata Tidak (Allies who Cannot Say No) "" at the National Gallery Jakarta in 2022, which re-framed Indonesia's history in the non-Alignment Movement 1955. The curatorial approach used scenography to frame the artwork in performative ways, incorporating staging, mis-en-scene, and spatial dramaturgy to create an immersive environment for the audience. The research argues that scenography can be a valuable tool for exhibition designers to evoke audience engagement and promote active participation in the exhibition. By developing a spatial metaphor within the curatorial narrative, designers can perform objects and create a more immersive experience. This approach can ultimately help museums to better communicate their collections and narratives, leading to increased visitor engagement and enjoyment. © 2023, Jomard Publishing.

Technological developments encourage faster digitization in the world. When a country cannot meet its own domestic demand for digital products that involve advanced technology, it tends to rely on importing high-technology products, specifically those in the field of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The aim of this study is to see how FDI and innovation influence the ICT goods imports in ASEAN 6. The analytical method used in this study is the Generalized Method of Moment panel data analysis of ASEAN's 6 countries, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, for 21 years from 2000 to 2020. Based on the results of the System GMM regression estimation, it was found that FDI had a positive and significant impact on ICT goods imports in most of the models. In comparison, innovation has a negative but not significant impact on ICT goods imports. Foreign investment has the potential to encourage imports of ICT products. In the short term, ICT goods imports are a necessity due to the absence of substitute products that have the same specifications and quality as imported products. In some cases, innovations may be in their infancy or not mature enough to significantly influence import patterns. Therefore, the government needs to consider long-term programs related to the development of industries capable of producing ICT goods. After the domestic industry has the capacity to produce ICT products, in the next stage, the government can consider policies on local content requirements to suppress imports, especially ICT goods. © 2023 IEEE."

Consequently, cybercriminals are launching more aggressive attacks on these networks. Intrusion detection systems, also known as IDS, extensively utilize pattern-matching methods based on signatures. This capability enables the systems to identify a wide variety of network-based attacks. To accurately detect anomalies or attacks, machine learning classifiers significantly enhance the robust performance of IDS compared to pattern-matching approaches based solely on packet features, such as packet lengths, flow duration, flags, and other characteristics. However, the accuracy of a single machine learning classifier method is relatively low in detecting a particular kind of attack due to the existence of different attack patterns. This research proposes a double layer machine learning approach based on the Random Forest and KNN algorithms. The aim is to identify the two most common types of attacks on web servers, namely DOS/DDOS and brute force attacks. Two distinct ML models were developed in parallel for IDS on web servers. The initial layer of the ML model comprises a 3-class classification approach using a random forest algorithm, enabling the identification of network records from the dataset as belonging to DoS, DDoS, and normal classes. The second layer of the ML model is constructed using KNN, which categorizes network records from the dataset into four classes, namely FTP-Patator, SSH-Patator, Web Brute Force, or normal. The selected features can significantly reduce both the training processing time and the prediction processing time.

There are large body of literature discuss the interaction of universities and the other Triple-helix model's agents, but rarely found and discuss intra helices interactions. This research explores the characteristics of Indonesian academic inventors' knowledge acquisition strategy for patenting in Indonesia. There are two points of view of this research: firstly, the study discusses the knowledge acquisition strategy of Indonesian universities in regard of the knowledge diversity among two collaborating universities and secondly, how is the magnitude of knowledge gaps between two entities influencing the decision for inhouse or out of university partner.Using the data from Sinta, knowledge diversity index is measured using Shannon entropy index of the academic inventor' expertise, university's department, and university's division. The research recognition's gap between two collaborating inventors is measured using the difference of their Scopus' h-indices. The findings show some interesting facts of how academic inventors strategize their collaboration patterns. First, interuniversity collaborations for patenting reveal more diversity on the academic inventors' knowledge than those are in intra-university collaborations. Second, collaborations for patenting with different universities expect better knowledge spill-overs than collaborations within a university. But, this knowledge spill-over only significant at individual level but not at institutional level. It seems that individual recognition is more important than institutional recognition when choosing a collaboration partner.  © 2023 IEEE."

Currently, safety testing heavily relies on the subjective expertise of a limited number of officers. To address this limitation, we present a novel approach using a smart mannequin embedded with advanced sensor systems, emulating human-like perception. The mannequin incorporates various sensors including accelerometers, temperature sensors, as well as gas, sound, and camera sensors. Leveraging the Raspberry Pi 4B and Node MCU, we employ Internet of Things (IoT) technology to enable real-time monitoring of driver and passenger conditions within the vehicle through a web-based interface. Rigorous laboratory and field experiments were conducted to evaluate the system's performance. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system in monitoring smart mannequins via web applications. The alert system successfully detects gas leaks, sounds, vibrations, temperature fluctuations, and humidity levels, while also providing valuable data on speed, vibration, and position using accelerometers and GPS. Empowering smart mannequins to assume the role of humans in conducting risky tests presents a significant advancement in vehicle safety testing. © 2023 WITPress. All rights reserved."

The Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia regulates book quality standards to ensure book quality. To meet the book quality standards outlined in this regulation, it is necessary to have a tool that can analyze the text readability in the book. Assessing text readability can be accomplished by employing a readability formula and constructing a machine-learning model. In this study, we focus on analyzing the readability of Indonesian texts. We build readability models by applying readability formula and machine learning approach as a two-step process. The first step is classifying the text into two categories: complex and simple, and the next step is identifying the text difficulty level according to readability formula. The readability formula measures the grade level and reader age. The experimental results show that the machine learning model successfully classified the text with 83.1% accuracy. On the other hand, the result of the readability formula is that the readability age is higher than the reader's age. The result of the readability formula is the predicted readability age is higher than the intended reader age. We analyzed the readability result and found that Indonesian textbook has more complex linguistic feature than English textbook, therefore the predicted reader age is higher.  © 2023 IEEE."

This has revolutionized the world of education. Choosing the correct course, meanwhile, becomes difficult as the number of users and courses rises. Therefore, an online course recommender system is needed. One of the recommender system paradigms is Collaborative Filtering (CF). CF uses two different sorts of approaches, i.e., memory-based collaborative filtering and model-based collaborative filtering. In memory-based CF recommendations are built with a neighborhood method that focuses on the relationship between items called item-based and the relationship between users called user-based. While model-based CF recommendations are built based on user ratings. Matrix factorization is proven to be a model-based technique that is able to provide good performance for recommender systems and is able to overcome the problem of high-dimensional data compared to other collaborative filtering techniques. Therefore, we built a recommender system in the online course domain using a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which is one of many matrix factorization techniques. To evaluate the effectiveness of testing the SVD model, we apply the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) evaluation metric. The evaluation results show that the SVD model outperforms the base model, as evidenced by the t-Test results with a sample size of ten experiments.  © 2023 IEEE."

Manufacturers from various brands are competing to introduce cutting-edge innovations with technological sophistication and unique features. A recommender system for cars has been developed but only based on technical specifications. However, cars have complex specifications, so many users do not familiar with the technical specification. Users find it easier to express their needs in terms of the functional aspects of a product rather than its technical features. To address this issue, we propose a conversational recommender system (CRS) to assist in interacting with users in order to elicit user need preferences. Therefore, we created a conversational recommendation system (CRS) designed to interact with users and capture their specific preferences. CRS engages users in conversations like sales professionals, facilitating natural and efficient interactions to uncover their specific desires. The model combines ontology structures and algorithms to effectively capture user preferences, taking into account explicit product information and temporal data to build domains and user profiles. The evaluation of this system focuses on two main parameters: system performance and user satisfaction.

Each group then divided into Non muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) subgroups. The smear was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-immunohistochemistry of CD24 and RA, followed by histoscore assessment. Results: The male to female smoking rates was 1.8. Based on gender, in the NMIBC group there were 85.7% men and 14.3% were women while in MIBC 74.4% men and 25.6% women. The mean age of the NMIBC and MIBC groups was 56.3 years and 54.5 years, respectively. There was no significant relationship between smoking status in group 2 (OR 0.31, CI 95% CI, p=0,39), group 3 (OR 013, CI 95% CI, p=0,05), and group 4 (OR 0.23, CI 95% CI, p=0215) to the UCB invasiveness. A significant relationship was observed between cytoplasmic AR expression and UCB invasiveness (OR 0.14[0,04; 0.47], CI 95%, p=0.001). There was no significant relationship between RA in the nucleus and UCB invasion (OR 1.09[0,18; 6.48] CI 95%, p=1000). No significant relationship was observed between CD24 expression and UCB invasiveness (OR 0.81[0,27–2,45] CI 95%, p=0712). Conclusion: Cytoplasmic AR expression is associated with UCB invasiveness. Smoking history and CD24 expression were not associated with UCB invasion. © 2023 Pramod et al."

First, the proposed filled function is non-exponential and non-logarithmic. This property is aimed at avoiding the overflow effect during the computational stage. Second, our method does not contain parameters, so the possibility of non-converging iterations can be prevented. Third, the filled function proposed in this paper is continuously differentiable. By this property, any local minimization procedures can be applied. Finally, the suggested filled function is dependent on the objective function, and thus it can provide any information for locating a minimum of the filled function.

However, the growth of agriculture is hindered by various factors, including attacks from Plant Pest Organisms, commonly known as pests. These pests pose a continuous threat to plants, leading to a decline in crop quality and significant impacts on society, such as economic and food security. The recurring pest attacks and inadequate pest control measures call for the development of an integrated pest control system. Previous pest control approaches have been reactive, solely based on past pest incidents, which lack preventive actions to anticipate future pest attacks. To address this issue, a pest prediction system is proposed as a preemptive measure to prevent crop failure caused by pest attacks. The prediction system employs Machine Learning techniques, specifically the Naïve Bayes algorithm, utilizing weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The system's effectiveness is evaluated on cabbage crops, and the testing results indicate an accuracy rate of 89%, precision of 83%, recall of 83%, and specificity of 92%.

Remarkably, the network for clean water distribution extends beyond urban areas and permeates even the remotest regions. Almost all clean water consumption records are manually logged by personnel, utilizing analog water meters affixed to main pipelines and household consumers. Oversights in analog meter readings may transpire, incurring losses for consumers. In contrast to analog water meters, digital counterparts can seamlessly amass real-time data through Automatic Water Meter Reading (AWMR) protocols. However, the migration from analog to digital meters is not instantaneous, as analog meter providers commonly forecast usage patterns for the upcoming five years from the point of installation initiation. An automatic water meter reading incorporates wireless access technology, establishing connections with postpaid and/or prepaid billing servers. This configuration significantly mitigates the potential for recording lapses. In this study, we present the design of an IoT-driven intelligent system that is built on low-power microcontrollers running image recognition and neural network algorithms.

Our translation system utilizes the IndoBART-V2 model, enabling seamless translations between Indonesian and Kailinese. We conducted two testing scenarios: one with a diverse dataset of reviews and random topics, and another focusing on review-type datasets. By employing default parameters and preprocessing techniques using the 'Colloquial Indonesian Lexicon Dictionary,' our translation model achieves impressive SacreBLEU scores compared to not using preprocessing or changing default parameters.

However, manually identifying crucial elements like preconditions and post-conditions within software requirements can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. This challenge has prompted a research study to propose a novel approach for test case generation using text classification. The proposed approach involves categorizing software requirements into two labels: 'none' and 'both.' These labels indicate the presence or absence of preconditions and post-conditions in software requirements. To achieve this, the research employs the Naive Bayes algorithm, a widely used probabilistic classification algorithm in text classification tasks. The algorithm leverages two libraries, namely Scikit-learn and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).

However, the accurate prediction of drug side effects is of paramount importance due to the associated risks involved. In this regard, machine learning algorithms offer promising avenues for early-stage identification of potential side effects, with in-silico approaches proving valuable for drug prediction. A notable in-silico method is SMILES2Vec, which utilizes word embedding techniques to encode a compound's molecular structure and generate vector representations of molecules. To evaluate its performance, this study employed a dataset from the SIDER (Side Effect Resource), specifically focusing on Hepatobiliary disorder side effects. The investigation involved assessing different layer combinations and optimizers within the SMILES2Vec model. In particular, the study explored the impact of introducing a convolution layer before the GRU layer and a dense layer after it, aiming to enhance the model's performance. The results revealed that a model consisting of l-layer convolution, 2-layer GRU, and 1-layer dense achieved the highest accuracy and F1-Score, reaching 64.39% and 67.39%, respectively. Furthermore, the Adagrad optimizer played a significant role by dynamically adjusting the learning rate for each parameter. This optimization technique not only improved the F1-Score to 68.62%, but also effectively prevented overfitting during the model training process. The evaluation of SMILES2Vec model's layer combinations and optimizers provided valuable insights for predicting drug side effects.

Air pollution is one type of problem that is triggered by air pollutant substances. In many cases, air pollution can cause several diseases that impact long-Term health. Substances that can cause air pollution include Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (03), Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5), and Particulate Matter 10 (PM10). In recent years, many methods have been proposed to detect air pollution but still use classical machine learning as the classification method. However, the accuracy does not increase when using classical machine learning, therefore this research uses an ensemble learning algorithm as a classifier because this method combines multiple classifier. The accuracy value obtained from the entire detection process is strongly influenced by the results at the classification stage. Therefore the authors propose the use of a classification algorithm that supports increased accuracy of air pollution detection. The proposed classification method with ensemble learning increases the accuracy. The experiment results show that the lowest f1-score is good class when detected using the default AdaBoost algorithm. The f1-score is 0%. After implementing hyperparameter tuning, there is an increase in the good class, ie.: 95%. The best class after hyperparameter tuning on the AdaBoost algorithm is a hazardous class with an f1-score of 100%. The accuracy value when using the AdaBoost algorithm by default is 62%.

The ALPR system consists of several stages. First, YOLOv8 is used to detect the vehicle license plate in the image captured by the DJI Tello Drone camera. YOLOv8 is an object detection method that is efficient and accurate in recognizing various objects, including vehicle license plates. Once the vehicle license plate is detected, the license plate image will be processed using the OpenCV library to improve image quality and facilitate the character recognition process. Furthermore, the system will use OCR, specifically the Pytesseract library, to recognize the characters on the vehicle number plate. From 50 photo samples, the success rate for license plate detection is 100%, and character recognition is 66%.

There has been a dramatic increase in the number of publications published on the topic of AD detection using deep learning since 2017.Deep models have been shown to improve AD detection accuracy compared to more traditional forms of machine learning. Classifying instances of AD needs a highly discriminative feature representation to discriminate between otherwise similar brain patterns, making AD diagnosis challenging despite recent progress.

However, the proliferation of GAN-generated content raises concerns about detecting artificially created faces. Therefore, it is important to detect artificially generated faces visually to prevent fraud, ensure security and privacy, maintain information credibility, and support law enforcement and public safety. To address this challenge, we present a system designed specifically to detect fake face images generated by AI. Our research contributes to the ongoing efforts in combating the challenges posed by GAN-generated fake content, particularly in the domain of face images. By developing robust detection systems, we can enhance our ability to identify and mitigate the potentially harmful consequences of deceptive or maliciously generated visual content. Our research leverages the Xception model, utilizing depthwise separable convolution as the underlying method for classification. We used a collection of 20.000 images comprising both generated faces from the StyleGAN dataset and real faces from CelebA-HQ. Our system's performance was evaluated using a testing set and has resulted in an impressive accuracy of 98.77%. The generated class has 98% in precision and f1-score, and 97% in recall.

PIR sensors are usually used to gather information about potentially hazardous object movements in the context of home security. Previous research has shown that the accuracy of movement detection depends on the number of sensors installed; the more sensors, the greater the accuracy. However, as the number of sensors increases, so does the detection time. Typically, systems with four sensors have an accuracy of about 90% and a detection time of 3 seconds. To address this issue, this research paper presents a solution using real-Time deep learning models to shorten the detection time of suspicious objects. This research also evaluates the performance of various deep learning methods to determine the best result (in terms of object detection time) for home security. Rigorous experiments have been conducted to check the performance of the proposed system, and the results showed a detection accuracy of over 90%. In addition, we identify the potential of this system to enhance home security efficiency and effectiveness by combining high accuracy and faster detection times. Rigorous experiments yielded a detection accuracy exceeding 90%, instilling confidence in the system's reliability.

In quantum systems, noise and decoherence can degrade the coherence of quantum states, leading to errors and reduced computational accuracy. DD employs carefully designed sequences of control pulses to periodically intervene and counteract these undesired interactions, while DFS utilizes subspace encoding techniques to protect quantum information from decoherence. To evaluate and compare the fidelity achieved by DD and DFS, this paper presents a series of experiments considering the effect of time and the number of qubits. The experiments provide valuable insights into the performance of both methods under different conditions. By systematically examining the fidelity results, the impact of time and the scaling behavior with increasing qubits can be assessed. The experimental findings showcase the effectiveness of DD in reducing the impact of noise and extending the coherence time of quantum states. By strategically manipulating the quantum system, DD minimizes error accumulation and preserves the integrity of fragile quantum information. It is observed that the decrease in fidelity with increasing t is relatively small and gradual. Despite being outperformed by DD, the DFS method exhibits robustness and maintains a high degree of fidelity even in the presence of extended time durations.  © 2023 IEEE."

The research reveals a strong positive correlation coefficient of 0.76 for positive sentiment and 0.7 for negative sentiment, as determined through the Spearman Rank correlation test. Additionally, the expansion of the GloVe feature improves the accuracy of the GRU classification model when combined with TF-IDF feature extraction. However, implementing the Globe feature expansion in the CNN classification model results in a decrease in accuracy by 73.9% compared to using only TF-IDF feature extraction. To address this, a hybrid CNN-GRU model with TF-IDF feature extraction and GloVe expansion is proposed, achieving a significant improvement in accuracy. The hybrid model outperforms the individual baselines, demonstrating an increase in accuracy of +1.88 compared to the best CNN baseline with feature extraction and +1.86 compared to the GRU baseline with GloVe feature and feature extraction. These findings emphasize the importance of considering sentiment analysis and feature expansion techniques in predicting the movement of BBCA shares. However, limitations of the study, such as the limited dataset and exclusive focus on Bank BCA's stock prices, highlight the need for future research to encompass a wider range of businesses and incorporate time-shifting techniques for a more comprehensive analysis.

The research method involves utilizing heart disease data consisting of 918 rows and 11 features. The data is preprocessed to ensure its quality and relevance for the subsequent classification tasks. To classify the heart disease data, we employ the random forest model using both default parameters and hyperparameter tuning. The default parameters represent the initial model configuration, while the hyperparameter tuning aims to optimize the model's performance by finding the best combination of hyperparameters. Following the classification process, we evaluate the models' performance using four metrics: f1 score, precision, recall, and accuracy. The results of this study indicate that after comparing the default parameter random forest model with the model using hyperparameter tuning, the latter achieves a significantly higher accuracy rate. The default parameter random forest model yields an accuracy of 89.13%, after applying hyperparameter tuning, the accuracy improves.

In this context, the use of object detection sensors that facilitate communication between drivers in blind spots has gained traction. This study addresses the pressing concern of road accidents in Indonesia, where statistics reveal a rising trend. By employing fuzzy logic with the Sugeno method, this research proposes a blind spot object detection system for trucks. The system integrates five ultrasonic sensors strategically positioned at the front, left, right, and rear sides of the truck, coupled with fuzzy logic algorithms to process the sensor data. Visual and auditory warning signals, such as buzzers and LEDs, are utilized to alert drivers of potential hazards. The device incorporates input values derived from observation results, utilizing the coefficient value of the sensor distance data. The validity test, employing R2 (R Square), reveals a remarkably strong correlation. This conclusion is supported by the author's meticulous observation of distance data from each sensor, performed 30 times, which yielded an average correlation value of 0.99.

Basically, MHW detection is calculated individually for each location, which is inefficient for large domain. This study aims to accelerate MHW detection by implementing a parallel computation technique. The parallel computation of MHW detection combines the MHW Python library proposed by Oliver et al., 201S and the joblib library based on pipelining in Python. We propose the parallelization in a single and nested loop and evaluate the performance of the parallelization in single and multi-nodes.

The relentless demands of work can take a toll on both the mind and body, leading to exhaustion and mental strain. When someone reaches their breaking point, emotions can become uncontrollable. To address this issue, this thesis proposes the development of flexible tools specifically designed for use during working hours. These tools leverage the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) method, which effectively detects pulse, sweat gland activity, and body temperature. The accuracy of GSR measurements depends on the individual's physical state during activities, and thus, specialized algorithms are developed for precise data interpretation. By utilizing this tool, individuals gain valuable insights into their stress levels. The tool acts as a facilitator in capturing and analyzing emotional patterns based on pulse, as identified through the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) stage. Examination of GSR measurements collected from data samples reveals distinctive variations in skin response to stress at different times of the day. For instance, during the morning hours, GSR ranges from 481 to 489, while daytime measurements range from 594 to 602. Notably, the GSR range tends to be lower at night, spanning from 392 to 404. These findings emphasize the significance of understanding fluctuations in skin response and the importance of utilizing GSR sensors to accurately measure stress levels.  © 2023 IEEE."

It is proven that innovation influences airport service quality, passenger satisfaction, and airport image. Like-wise, service quality affects airport satisfaction and image. Passenger satisfaction has succeeded in mediating innovation, the quality of airport services, and their influence on the airport's image. Through these findings, it is hoped that it will be useful for airport operators to carry out con-tinuous innovation in supporting services so that it has a positive effect on passengers and, in the long term, improves the airport's image. Future research is expected to examine the effect of image on the desire of passengers to make other paid transactions in the airport terminal area. © 2023 AJHTL /Author(s) All Rights Reserved."

Traditional fire detection systems, which rely on temperature, air concentration, and particle movement, often fail to detect fires in early stages and are costly to install in existing structures. These limitations can be mitigated by visual-based fire detection systems utilizing existing CCTV cameras, offering a more practical and cost-effective solution. Such systems are possible with advancements in computer vision and machine learning to enhance fire detection capabilities, circumventing the need for significant structural modifications. This paper describes the methodology of a combined approach using HSV-based Harris Corner extraction and Vision Transformer classification for fire detection research. HSV color conversion was used to filter objects with fire-like color properties, then Harris Corner Detection was applied to filter objects with fire-like shape attributes. By using both rules, potential fire region of interests could be identified, these regions are then classified by a Vision Transformer model to determine whether they contain fire or not. The dataset used in this research was made up of 2,640 images of both indoor and outdoor lightning conditions, 1,200 fire images and 1,000 non-fire images for the training set, and a separate 240 fire and 200 non-fire images for the evaluation set.

In semantic segmentation, CNN-based approaches have been known to dominate the semantic segmentation field, such as FCN and DeepLabv3+. The success of the Transformer approach in the Nature Language Processing (NLP) area triggered many researchers to use the Transformer approach in solving semantic segmentation problems, so the Vision Transformer (ViT) was born. ViT accepts images as patches to produce local and global attention, unlike the convolution approach. One ViT-inspired model, SegFormer, combines a Hierarchical Transformer encoder component to generate low-resolution fine features that focus on capturing small detailed, fine-grained information such as edges, corners, and local patterns, and high-resolution coarse features that focus on capturing more general and global characteristics of a scene, and a lightweight All-MLP decoder to combine those multi-level features to produce the final semantic segmentation mask. This allows SegFormer to capture local and global contextual information from an image. This paper proposed the SegFormer model to perform semantic segmentation of bone scan images into 12 classes based on bone regions. As a result, by comparing FCN and DeepLabv3+ convolution approaches, SegFormer outperforms both models with the highest mIoU value of 77.86%.  © 2023 IEEE."

As for the classification of coffee fruit maturity levels automatically, it can be faster with objective determination, therefore the use of image processing is relatively easier, faster, and based on a quantified descriptive assessment to determine coffee maturity. Image Processing is a method used to process or manipulate images in 2-dimensional form. In the classification process, there are many methods used to obtain classification of objects based on training data. One of the algorithms used for the classification process is K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). KNN is a classification technique for objects based on training data that is the closest or has similar characteristics to the object. KNN includes supervised learning algorithms, where the results of the new query instance are classified based on the majority of the categories in K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN).

The goal is to develop a classification model using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms that are often implemented in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) technology. The tasks to be solved are as follows: preprocessing the EEG dataset signal to separate the source signal from the noise/artifact signal to produce an observation signal that is free of noise/artifact; obtaining an effective feature comparison to be used as an attribute at the classification stage; and developing a more optimal classification method for detecting people with ASD through EEG signals. The methods used are: one of the wavelet techniques, namely the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), which is a technique for decomposing time-frequency signals. CWT began to be used in EEG signals because it can describe signals in great detail in the time-frequency domain. EEG signals are classified into two scenarios: classification of CWT coefficients and classification of statistical features (mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis) of CWT. The method used for classifying this research uses ML, which is currently very developed in signal processing. One of the best ML methods is Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is an effective super-vised learning method to separate data into different classes by finding the hyperplane with the largest margin among the observed data. The following results were obtained: the application of CWT and SVM resulted in the best classification based on CWT coefficients and obtained an accuracy of 95% higher than the statistical feature-based classification of CWT, which obtained an accuracy of 65%. Conclusions. The scientific contributions of the results obtained are as follows: 1) EEG signal processing is performed in ASD children using feature extraction with CWT and classification with SVM; 2) the combination of these signal classification methods can improve system performance in ASD EEG signal classification; 3) the implementation of this research can later assist in detecting ASD EEG signals based on brain wave characteristics. © Melinda Melinda, Filbert H.

In this study, the RTE technique is employed as the prediction method that combines multiple regression trees to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Historical data collected from the TULT building serves as the training dataset for the model. To assess the model's performance, evaluation is conducted utilizing the R-squared ($R^{2}$) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) methods to quantify the error. The evaluation on temperature measurements show that the model achieves a low MAE of 0.28608 in the test data. In the training data, the MAE is even lower, at 0.00397. For humidity measurements, the model exhibits a higher MAE of 7.0043 in the test data, indicating higher error rates in humidity predictions. Similarly, the MAE in the training data is 0.1086, showing that the model performs better on the data it was trained on but still experiences higher errors in the test data. In terms of $R^{2}$ values, the model achieves an $R^{2}$ of 0.3159 in the test data for temperature measurement, indicating that it can explain approximately 31.59% of the variance in temperature data.

As new metaheuristics, the modification of these two metaheuristics is still rare. Based on this circumstance, this work constructs a new metaheuristic called as migrating walrus algorithm (MWA) based on the hybridization of both MA and WaOA to create a better metaheuristic than them. MWA consists of five migrations: four directed migrations and one local migration. The references used in these directed migrations are the best walrus, a randomly picked better walrus, a randomly picked walrus, and two randomly picked walruses. In this work, two assessments are carried out: the comparative assessment and the individual migration assessment. The 23 functions are selected as theoretical use cases. In the comparative assessment, MWA is confronted with five new metaheuristics: MA, WaOA, attack leave optimization (ALO), coati optimization algorithm (COA), and osprey optimization algorithm (OOA). The result shows that MWA is better than ALO, COA, MA, OOA, and WaOA in 19, 19, 19, 17, and 17 functions. On the other hand, the individual migration assessment result indicates that the multiple migration approach is important to maintain the superiority of MWA with the directed migration toward the best walrus becoming the most important contributor. This result also strengthens the necessity of the multiple searches strategy rather than a single strategy. © (2023), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society). All Rights Reserved."

In mmWave frequencies, it is important to evaluate the SNR value in the context of a full 6G Terahertz network to improve network performance. Our research methodology includes a method for measuring SNR in a full 6G terahertz network using the 3GPP NR standard. We collect data about the environment and identify factors affecting SNR performance. In addition, we will compare the results of the SNR analysis with the standards set by the company. By comparing SNR values in full 6G Terahertz networks, our research results provide valuable insights for 6G network developers. The results show that varying transmitter power (Ptx) and antenna factor (F) did not significantly affect the average SNR value, which remained around 36.13327635. However, the distance between the sender and receiver had a crucial impact. At a distance of 30 meters, the SNR reached its most efficient value of 40.60682455.

Because glaucoma rarely shows early symptoms in the sufferer, it requires regular observation of the retinal fundus by an ophthalmologist to find out if this eye disorder appears. Doctors' observations are subjective, so they are inconsistent and take a long time. As a result, a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system was created that can automate the examination of retinal fundus images to detect glaucoma in its initial phase. In a consistent and time-saving manner by using optic disc and cup segmentation and cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) computation. CAD systems can also be used as decision support by doctors. Several previous image segmentation studies have proposed using convolution neural network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) based models and their combinations. However, the encoder-decoder model based on CNN is large and is slow in computation. The ViT model has the problem that the computational amount of the model increases when the image size also increases. Therefore, the segmentation method uses a Swin Transformer-based encoder-decoder model, Swin-Unet, which has the advantage of a self-attention mechanism performed on local windows and has linear computation. This paper presents a case study of optical disc and cup segmentation using the Swin-Unet method with the REFUGE dataset. The vCDR calculation with a threshold of 0.63 yields an accuracy of 94%. The IoU score results using the REFUGE dataset resulted in a score of 84% for the disc part and 80% for the cup part.  © 2023 IEEE."

As a collective understanding, kokoro-dzukai also transcends into ethos and aesthetics in making practices and design thinking. Based on the author’s life in Japan as a design student, observer, and worker on several Muslim-friendly design projects, this chapter explores how thoughtfulness and consideration are distributed in activities and social spaces. Through the framework of '‘efficacious intimacy’, kokoro-dzukai is traced as a technique of identifying and situating life wisdom in and through bodily and material practices while using the kokoro (heart) to make the considerate subject. By exploring kokoro as the seat of knowledge acquisition, the praxis of the everyday as experiential learning and transformation is highlighted. The practice of kokoro-dzukai creates a sense of closeness between people, being mediated through making and objects, and shaping the relationship between self, subject, and intersubjectivity. In addition to the experiences of makers and doers of different kinds, this chapter also explores the perspectives of a few Japanese converts to Islam, and how they negotiate their religiosity by re-discovering the morality of kokoro-dzukai as well as relating Shinto-Buddhist concepts to Islamic philosophy. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Urmila Mohan; individual chapters, the contributors."

By evaluating the process, the research aims to understand the causality behind these bottlenecks and propose effective solutions for enhancing efficiency and reducing time costs. The research employs the PM4Py open-source toolkit, including PM4Py-GPU for computationally intensive tasks. Through fitness alignments between event logs and process models, it is found that approximately 47.128 percent of traces match the process model, exhibiting a good level of conformity with an average fitness of 0.8888. Notably, the study reveals that over 3 percent of billing processes in regional hospitals exhibit repetitive occurrences of specific activities consecutively. The identification of this repetitive activity pattern prompts a deeper investigation into its root causes and implications for resource utilization and performance. By addressing these causative factors, the research aims to propose optimized approaches to streamline the billing process, thus enhancing overall efficiency and customer satisfaction levels for the hospitals. Overall, the findings of this study contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the billing process in healthcare services and provide valuable insights for hospitals to implement targeted improvements, reduce delays, and offer high-quality services to their patients.  © 2023 IEEE."

To reduce the EM coupling, a guard trace, a structure consisting of a microstrip line with grounded vias, is inserted between the antenna patches. Parametric studies are carried out to determine the parameters of guard-trace, including the number of vias and the via diameter. To investigate the effectiveness of guard trace utilization for EM coupling reduction, a two-elements microstrip patch antenna array with a guard trace is designed to work at the frequency of 2.4 GHz. While to verify the design, the prototype of microstrip patch antenna array is realized and characterized. Measurement results indicate a coupling reduction of about 5 dB can be achieved when a 4-vias guard trace with the via diameter of 1 mm is inserted between the antenna patches separated by an edge-to-edge distance of 4 mm. Since the strongest coupling reduction occurs at very close distances between antennas, implementation of the proposed concept to massive elements antenna arrays is potential to reduce their footprint.  © 2023 IEEE."

This work measures ISB using a complete measuring scale and explains the relevant influential factors from the perspectives of Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and General Deterrence Theory (GDT) Background Internal users are the primary source of security concerns in hospitals, with malware and social engineering becoming common attack vectors in the health industry. This study focuses on HIS user behavior in developing countries with limited information security policies and resources. Methodology The research was carried out in three stages. First, a semi-structured interview was conducted with three hospital administrators in charge of HIS implementa-tion to investigate information security controls and threats. Second, a survey of 144 HIS users to determine ISB based on hospital security risk. Third, a semi-structured interview was conducted with 11 HIS users to discuss the ele-ments influencing behavior and current information security implementation. Contribution This study contributes to ISB practices in hospitals. It discusses how HIS man-agers could build information security programs to enhance health profession-als' behavior by considering PMT and GDT elements. Findings According to the findings of this study, the hospital has implemented particular information security management system (ISMS) controls based on interna-tional standards, but there is still room for improvement. Insiders are the most prevalent information security dangers discovered, with certain working prac-tices requiring HIS users to disclose passwords with others. The top three most common ISBs HIS users practice include appropriately disposing of printouts, validating link sources, and using a password to unlock the device. Meanwhile, the top three least commonly seen ISBs include transferring sensitive infor-mation online, leaving a password in an unsupervised area, and revealing sensi-tive information via social media. Recommendations for Practitioners Hospital managers should create work practices that align with information se-curity requirements. HIS managers should provide incentives to improve work-ers' perceptions of the benefit of robust information security measures. Recommendations for Researchers This study suggests more research into the components that influence ISB uti-lizing diverse theoretical foundations such as Regulatory Focus Theory to com-pare preventive and promotion motivation to enhance ISB. Impact on Society This study can potentially improve information security in the healthcare indus-try, which has substantial risks to human life but still lags behind other vital sec-tor implementations. Future Research Future research could look into the best content and format for an information security education and training program to promote the behaviors of healthcare professionals that need to be improved based on this ISB measurement and other influential factors. © 2023 Informing Science Institute.

However, drug molecules can interact with non-Target proteins, leading to the possibility of side effects. Hence, it is necessary to be able to predict the side effects to prevent more severe conditions. Several approaches are commonly used to predict side effects. However, these approaches have several weaknesses, such as safety procedure requirements that are pretty minimal and less accurate. In-silico approach that uses numerical and computational tools can be implemented as an alternative method in predicting side effects. This approach has advantages in reducing experimental process risks. This study aims to implement SMILES based descriptor, or commonly called SMILES2Vec, of drug molecule on LSTM method to predict side effect, for the case study of hepatobiliary disorder. SMILES based representation of descriptor is preferable because the calculation is faster than other descriptor, such as 2D, 3D, fingerprint, etc. Meanwhile, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was used for the prediction since this method is suitable with 1D type of SMILES based descriptor. The architecture of LSTM was determined by using manual tuning approach by determining several schemes. According to the result, we found that LSTM architecture with a combination of CONV and 2-layer of LSTM using Adagrad or Adadelta optimizer gives the best performance with values of F-1 score 68.62% for both.  © 2023 IEEE."

Because of the enormous number of users and the intensity with which it is utilized, Twitter may also be used to perform sentiment analysis to search for information relating to a product or topic. On Twitter, movie reviews are consistently one of the most popular topics of conversation. Because everyone's thoughts on movie reviews might refer to a variety of elements, aspect-based sentiment analysis is a method that can be used to discover the opinions that Twitter users have regarding movie reviews based on those characteristics. As a result, this method can produce more accurate and useful results. The research developed an aspect-based sentiment analysis system by using datasets of movie reviews written in Indonesian. These datasets consisted of three aspects: The plot, the acting, and the director. The classification model makes use of the Reccurent Neural Networks (RNN) approach, which extracts features using TF-IDF and expands on features using FastText. Unbalanced data is handled with SMOTE. The research found that plot elements had an accuracy of 77.24 percent and an F1 Score of 77.19 percent, while acting aspects had an accuracy of 96.59 percent and an F1 Score of 96.59 percent, and director aspects had a 97.75 percent accuracy and an F1 Score of 97.74 percent.  © 2023 IEEE."

Most lecturers usually input data on SISTER. The same data is sometimes inputted again into SIMPEG by staff in the personnel department. Apart from wasting time, this activity results in duplication of data, and sometimes errors in data input occur. So that the existing data in SISTER, especially related to lecturer profiles, is in sync with data in other systems, it is proposed to carry out system integration.

In the discovery process, parallel conditions can be deduced from the concurrent flows between activities. Concurrent patterns can be identified by tracing pairs of sequences in opposite directions between two activities. Long parallel blocks allow incomplete concurrent relationship (ICR) phenomena when the observed data only provides a one-way sequence flow against conditions that should be concurrent. All state-of-the-art algorithms starting from Graph-based Process Discovery (GPD), Inductive Miner (IM), and Split Miner (SM), detect ICR as a sequence so that the quality of the resulting model decreases. This paper proposes the GPD++ algorithm for block detection of complex structures by combining algorithms from GPD and SM and handling ICR for each detected parallel block. The experiment compared IM, SM, and GPD++ using real-life data from the container loading and unloading process during import activities and some public data.

Indonesia has a fracture injury prevalence of 5.5% with the distribution of injuries to the upper extremities 32.7% and 67.9% to the lower extremities. Treatment of bone fractures is generally done by radiological examination. X-ray is a tool that is commonly used to detect bone fractures because it is the easiest and fastest. However, the use of X-rays in the long term can cause radiation effects of ionizing radiation. Therefore, it is necessary to use alternative imaging methods. One method that can be considered for detecting fractures without causing radiation effects is bio-impedance. Basically, biological systems have both resistive and capacitive properties. If a voltage or electric current is injected with a frequency variation, an electrical impedance spectrum will be obtained which is a characteristic of biological tissue called Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The impedance spectrum is directly related to the properties of body tissues. This research was conducted using an EIS based on Analog Discovery, a phantom 3D Printed Model of femur made from Poly Lactic Acid (PLA) as a phantom of human femur bones with normal bone and bone fractures. Impedance measurements were carried out with a frequency variation range of 100 Hz to 1 MHz.

To address this challenge, we propose a conversational recommender system (CRS) that prioritizes functional needs, providing personalized recommendations through interactive user engagement. The CRS acts as a professional sales support, guiding users to express their functional requirements and aiding decision-making. Leveraging ontology as a knowledge representation, the system effectively maps functional requirement to specific product features, facilitating accurate recommendations. Our evaluation of the CRS considers user satisfaction and recommendation accuracy, which attains an accuracy rate of 87.91% with positive user satisfaction feedback.

Wave forecasting is very necessary to support daily marine activities such as marine transportation scheduling and daily operation offshore or in the harbor, so that these activities can be carried out with careful planning and can minimize the risk of accidents. Significant wave height (SWH) and peak wave period (Tp) predictions are essential to wave forecasting. In this research, we perform a time series wave forecasting for SWH and Tp using a relatively recent deep learning model, i.e., Transformer. As a case study, we choose a location in the southern part of Java island, Indonesia, i.e., on the Cilacap coast. We also compare the Transformer results with the well-known LSTM model. Transformer is used because it has an architecture based on encoder and decoder methods which allows this model to learn data better and also train the model faster in terms of performance. Meanwhile, LSTM is used because it's ability to remember long backward historical data. The result shows that the Transformer model performs better in terms of correlation coefficient and root mean squared error than the LSTM model for Hs. At the same time, LSTM came as a better model for Tp than the Transformer.  © 2023 IEEE."

This research synthesizes a classification methodology with machine learning with severity classification in BSM for VANET. We use datasets from previous research, which were obtained based on simulations. Then we carry out pre-processing, including a feature selection process with the novel multinomial naïve Bayes features selection (MNBFS), standardization, and oversampling. We designed four machine learning models to compare: decision tree, SVM, naïve Bayes, and KNN. Finally, we reached the four methods with the receiver operating curve (ROC), the area under the curve (AUC), and the compression ratio (CR). The test results show that SVM is the machine learning model with the best performance. Then the normalization process can improve SVM performance. The SVM AUC value for severity classification in VANET is 0.986. We also reveal the findings of our novel feature selection method.

As continuous development of these systems, there is a growing need for compact and lightweight components. The use of substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) structure can assist to reduce losses at high frequencies while also minimizing the component size. Furthermore, the use of artificial dielectric material (ADM) structures can also reduce the size of radio frequency (RF) component without compromising its performance. However, combination of these structures can make the fabrication process more complex and significantly increase the weight of filter. Therefore, a 3D printing technology is utilized to manufacture SIW filter with ADM incorporation. After the manufacturing and conductive paint coating processes, a prototype of 3D printed polylactid acid (PLA) based SIW filter incorporated with ADM structure is experimentally characterized, in which it operates at multiple frequency bands with the center frequencies of 2.71 GHz, 3.835 GHz, and 5.14 GHz, and the bandwidth responses of 135 MHz, 315 MHz, and 900 MHz, respectively.  © 2023 IEEE."

Gadget recommender systems have been developed to help users find products according to their preferences. However, these systems often ask questions about technical specifications, thus confusing novice users. For this reason, a gadget recommender system is needed in which the question interaction uses functional requirements so that all users are able to understand it. Because most users are more familiar with and find it easier to express their needs through gadget functions, for example, a user needs a gadget for live streaming activities, playing HD quality games, online meetings, and programming but does not need editing activities. Therefore, we develop a conversational recommender system (CRS) that recommends gadgets based on functional requirements. The system mimics the interaction of a knowledgeable salesperson, guiding users toward products that suit their needs. Our proposed system uses ontology as a knowledge base to map functional requirements to product specifications. Through performance evaluation and user satisfaction, our system achieved a recommendation accuracy score of 84.04% and a user satisfaction score of 0.76.

To make sure that AFIB are detected in a timely manner and prevent potential life-Threatening incidents, the patients must undergo continuous monitoring. However, it is difficult to develop a readily available and inexpensive method for detecting AFIB using ECG signals due to the technical challenges and cost associated with procuring ECG signals. To overcome this problem, we explored the use of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals acquired from smartphone camera to detect AFIB using ECG based ensemble learning model. ECG dataset are used due to the abundance of publicly available datasets, and the strong correlation between ECG and PPG in the RR Interval and Peak-To-peak Interval, respectively. Our goal was to develop a cheap, readily available, real-Time method for detecting AFIB. The resulting classification method achieves 82.94%, 90.00%, 81.65%, and 89.00% of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and f1 score, respectively.  © 2023 IEEE."

However, effectively analyzing the vast and diverse range of reviews necessitates the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and advanced language models. This research proposes the utilization of a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model and an optimized RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT approach) model for multi-label classification tasks, with the objective of comprehending consumer reviews more efficiently. To conduct the study, a dataset was compiled by collecting reviews from Amazon.com using a dedicated scraping platform. Additionally, a Kaggle public dataset was incorporated to augment the dataset's comprehensiveness. The fine-tuned BERT and optimized RoBERTa models were employed to analyze the collected data and extract meaningful insights. The experimental results indicate that the RoBERTa model exhibits superior performance compared to the BERT model, as evidenced by its macro-averaged F1 score of 0.87 and micro-averaged F1 score of 0.85. These results highlight the robustness and efficacy of the RoBERTa model in effectively comprehending consumer reviews for the given task of multilabel classification. By leveraging the proposed approach, which combines NLP techniques and advanced language models, the study contributes to enhancing the understanding of consumer feedback and enables more efficient analysis of clothing product reviews. The findings underscore the potential of leveraging state-of-the-art language models for improving the quality and relevance of consumer-driven insights in the fashion industry.  © 2023 IEEE."

In 2020, the spread of covid 19 had its peak in Indonesia. Based on data as in 2020 until 2023, from the World Health Organization, the cumulative total of cases in Indonesia is 16 million. As of mid-July 2023, COVID-19 cases are still evolving despite a decline. There has been a total of 6 million positive cases in the past 4 months. The spread of Covid-19 occurs very quickly and widely because it spreads from direct human contact with droplets from the respiratory tract of an infected person. At present, to be able to detect Covid-19 early, it is carried out using rapid antigen, swab, and PCR tests which are relatively expensive and require a long testing time, trained testing personnel, and complicated equipment. Forced coughing is one of the methods offered to replace the existing method. Making applications using forced cough recordings can be an alternative solution for early detection of Covid-19 through an Android-based application.

Glaucoma can cause vision loss if not treated quickly and appropriately. In this case, the observation of an ophthalmologist is needed to check it. However, an expert doctor's observation is subjective, so it takes a long time and is inconsistent. So a computer-Aided diagnostic (CAD) system was built to detect glaucoma early on, fundus image analysis automation, time efficiency through optical disc and cup segmentation, and Cup to Disc Ratio (CDR) calculations. Several previous studies have proposed using models based on Vision Transformers (ViT), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and a combination of the two. However, the ViT model has problems: The number of model computations increases when the image size also increases, and the CNN-based encoder-decoder model has a large size and is slow in its calculations. Therefore, a segmentation method that utilizes transformers as encoders and convolution as decoders was chosen, namely the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT), which can process data in parallel.

This approach is made so that the information about ocean wave conditions can be obtained in a high resolution and more accurate. Accurate wave forecasting information can prevent accidents when carrying out marine activities highly dependent on wave conditions, such as shipping, ocean engineering, and other maritime operations. Traditional local approach for local wave forecasting is usually obtained by performing simulation from global grid wave information into a high-resolution local grid using numerical simulation. This approach demands high computational cost. We propose a machine-learning approach for downscaling modeling that will use global wave height data and turn it into high-resolution local wave height data using the Transformer model. We use the local wave data from the result of Simulating Wave Nearshore (SWAN) numerical model simulation of the global dataset from ERA5to train the model. We chose Jakarta Bay as a case study. Moreover, we also compare the results of the Transformer model with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory. Results of the experiments show promising results; we found that the Transformer has overall good performance with a CC of 0.971, RMSE of 0.043, and MAPE of 11.763, and we also find that the training process for Transformer is faster 5 times faster than Bi-LSTM.  © 2023 IEEE."

Knowing the sentiments of users can help companies evaluate the chatbots. However, the chatbot is made using a decision dialogue method so it has no knowledge of the sentiment of a sentence. Traditional data mining methods such as converting words to vectors are no longer efficient because of the limited representation of sentences. Therefore, we need a method that can connect words between words so that the model can understand it better, namely using graph-based representation. We represent a graph with words as nodes along with their node properties in the form of vectors and edges using a dependency parser to connect these nodes. With graphs we can represent text better such as being able to include the part of speech of the word, the number of letters, and so on. Data that has been converted to graph will be processed with a graph-based model. In this study, we compare traditional methods with graph-based methods in terms of the performance and inference time in detecting the sentiment of a sentence. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the graph-based model achieves a comparable level of accuracy (0.7173) to that of the tree-based model. However, when it comes to inference time, the graph-based models outperform the tree-based models, being three times faster.  © 2023 IEEE."

ACA is a metaheuristic technique based on swarm intelligence. ACA contains three steps. Each agent moves closer to the global reference in the first step. Then, each agent searches for a better solution around the current solution in the second step. The global reference searches for better solutions around it in the third step. This algorithm is named cone because the local space size declines linearly during the iterative process. ACA introduces a new adaptability model to improve the exploration strategy when a better solution cannot be achieved. It is conducted by enlarging the local solution space. ACA is challenged to find the final solution for theoretical and practical problems. The 23 functions are chosen as theoretical optimization problems. The portfolio optimization problem is selected as the practical problem. ACA is compared with five algorithms: particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), marine predator optimization (MPA), average subtraction-based optimizer (ASBO), and pelican optimization algorithm (POA). The result shows that ACA is competitive in finding the optimal solution for 23 functions and outperforms all sparing algorithms in achieving the highest total capital gain in tackling the portfolio optimization problem.

This architecture leverages the strength of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in capturing high-level features. Usually, the CED architectures use the gated recurrent unit (GRU) or long-short-term memory (LSTM) as a bottleneck to capture temporal dependencies, enabling a SE model to effectively learn the dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies in the speech signal. However, Transformers neural networks with self-attention effectively capture long-term temporal dependencies. This study proposes a multi-attention bottleneck (MAB) comprised of a self-attention Transformer powered by a time-frequency attention (TFA) module followed by a channel attention module (CAM) to focus on the important features. The proposed bottleneck (MAB) is integrated into a CED architecture and named MAB-CED. The MAB-CED uses an encoder-decoder structure including a shared encoder and two decoders, where one decoder is dedicated to spectral masking and the other is used for spectral mapping. Convolutional Gated Linear Units (ConvGLU) and Deconvolutional Gated Linear Units (DeconvGLU) are used to construct the encoder-decoder framework. The outputs of two decoders are coupled by applying coherent averaging to synthesize the enhanced speech signal. The proposed speech enhancement is examined using two databases, VoiceBank+DEMAND and LibriSpeech. The results show that the proposed speech enhancement outperforms the benchmarks in terms of intelligibility and quality at various input SNRs. This indicates the performance of the proposed MAB-CED at improving the average PESQ by 0.55 (22.85%) with VoiceBank+DEMAND and by 0.58 (23.79%) with LibriSpeech. The average STOI is improved by 9.63% (VoiceBank+DEMAND) and 9.78% (LibriSpeech) over the noisy mixtures. © 2013 IEEE."

Our proposed model combines the ROS oversampling technique with a linear SVM kernel. We evaluated the proposed model and resulted in an accuracy of 97% and compared it with several experiments, including the ROS technique with a sigmoid kernel which only resulted in 50% accuracy. It can be seen from the results obtained that the linear kernel is very adaptive to data types in the form of numeric and nominal compared to other kernels.

To provide this, a camera will be placed in front of the device to provide real-Time visualization of the needle as it is moved. The camera will read the location or coordinates of the spinal needle, providing feedback for the device. This visual feedback allows the user to monitor the needle's position and make any necessary adjustments for proper placement. To accomplish this, a needle detection system needs to be created as a subsystem for the device using deep learning and object detection techniques with the YOLOv8 model. The system achieves Precision-Recall of 79% in training with 95% accuracy in testing on detecting spinal needles in real-Time, with the potential to improve the accuracy of the spinal testing device by providing reliable needle location.  © 2023 IEEE."

Several studies used single biomarkers such as qNet and Repolarization Abnormality (RA) in a single cardiac cell model to evaluate TdP risk. However, a single biomarker may not encompass the full range of factors contributing to TdP risk, leading to divergent TdP risk prediction outcomes, mainly when evaluated using unseen data. We addressed this issue by utilizing multi-in silico features from a population of human ventricular cell models that could capture a representation of the underlying mechanisms contributing to TdP risk to provide a more reliable assessment of drug-induced cardiotoxicity. Method: We generated a virtual population of human ventricular cell models using a modified O’Hara-Rudy model, allowing inter-individual variation. (Formula presented.) and Hill coefficients from 67 drugs were used as input to simulate drug effects on cardiac cells. Fourteen features ((Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), qNet, qInward) could be generated from the simulation and used as input to several machine learning models, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Optimization of the machine learning model was performed using a grid search to select the best parameter of the proposed model. We applied five-fold cross-validation while training the model with 42 drugs and evaluated the model’s performance with test data from 25 drugs. Result: The proposed ANN model showed the highest performance in predicting the TdP risk of drugs by providing an accuracy of 0.923 (0.908–0.937), sensitivity of 0.926 (0.909–0.942), specificity of 0.921 (0.906–0.935), and AUC score of 0.964 (0.954–0.975). Discussion and conclusion: According to the performance results, combining the electrophysiological model including inter-individual variation and optimization of machine learning showed good generalization ability when evaluated using the unseen dataset and produced a reliable drug-induced TdP risk prediction system.

The study performed three experiments to identify the most significant risk factors for hypertension and analyze their impact on the condition's development over multiple years. The first experiment revealed that Smart pruning, Deterministic ordering, and Deterministic sampling methods produced the best performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and Phi-coefficient. In the second experiment, the decision tree model's performance was similar to other machine learning models in terms of accuracy and standard deviation but with much shorter training and scoring times.

Test cases can be generated either manually or automatically. Creating test cases manually has several disadvantages, such as higher probability in producing inaccurate results. Furthermore, generating test cases manually is ineffective since manual methods will take longer and require high human efforts. Therefore, generating test cases automatically is more preferable to limit the previous problems. Automated testing can also provide more accurate results than manual testing because it is less prone to human errors encouraging software developers to generate test cases automatically. Test cases can be generated from various sources, including UML diagrams. In this paper, we propose a method to generate test cases automatically by utilising depth-first search algorithms. The UML diagram used in this study is an activity diagram. This paper also provides a method to parse activity diagram that is created using the visual paradigm application that has been converted into an XML format. Our method is able to parse and convert the XML format into graph or tree form. Using our proposed method, a test case search will be carried out using the depth-first search on the tree form to generate test cases. Lastly, we also evaluate our method by comparing the generated test cases with cyclomatic complexity, the method will be performed manually and automatically to validate the results of many scenarios.

However, creating high-level questions requires significant creativity and effort. Automatic question generation is expected to facilitate the generation of not only fluent and relevant but also educationally valuable questions. While rule-based methods are intuitive for short inputs, they struggle with longer and more complex inputs. Neural question generation (NQG) has shown better results in this regard. This review summarizes the advancements in NQG between 2016 and early 2022. The focus is on the development of NQG for educational purposes, including challenges and research opportunities. We found that although NQG can generate fluent and relevant factoid-type questions, few studies focus on education. Specifically, there is limited literature using context in the form of multi-paragraphs, which due to the input limitation of the current deep learning techniques, require key content identification. The desirable key content should be important to specific topics or learning objectives and be able to generate certain types of questions. A further research opportunity is controllable NQG systems, which can be customized by taking into account factors like difficulty level, desired answer type, and other individualized needs. Equally important, the results of our review also suggest that it is necessary to create datasets specific to the question generation tasks with annotations that support better learning for neural-based methods. © 2023, The Author(s)."

Daytime hours typically exhibit higher air humidity levels, a phenomenon similarly observed in building heights. Take, for instance, the Telkom University Landmark Tower (TULT) building. Varied heights within the structure influence temperature and humidity levels. In the academic year 2022/2023, Telkom University in Bandung, West Java, admitted 8,036 new students, a fraction of whom engage in lectures within the TULT building. It is plausible that the influx of students through different entrances to TULT could impact temperature at various altitudes. To address this, the application of Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Internet of Things (IoT) methodologies becomes pertinent for predicting temperature and humidity at distinct TULT heights. This involves utilizing the Blynk application for data collection and analysis. Subsequently, the MLR and IoT algorithms are employed to estimate temperature and humidity values. The experimental results are then scrutinized utilizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to anticipate error values for each trial. Additionally, the coefficient of determination, R2 or R Square, is utilized for analysis.

Detecting hate speech on social media, particularly on Twitter, has recently become a widely researched topic. Research that has been conducted usually applies a standard machine learning approach. The deep learning approach has become popular because it provides better and more effective results. However, it's still rare to be applied to detect hate speech in Indonesian language texts. This research shows the results of a performance comparison from the deep learning approach using CNN, LSTM, and CNN+LSTM architecture models for detecting hate speech in tweets using the Indonesian language. The dataset used is divided into a general dataset which is the entire dataset and a specific topic dataset that deals with the topic of government, which was taken from the general dataset. The research shows better results when the CNN architecture model is implemented on Indonesian language tweet data compared to the results obtained from the LSTM architecture model and the combination of CNN+LSTM with accuracy and F1-score reaching 81%. Furthermore, the implementation of deep learning models in detecting hate speech performs better than previous research using the same dataset but applying machine learning models with feature extraction. This research also shows that specific data discussing a particular topic significantly impact the model's performance. Thus the version of the model becomes better when applied to data with a general topic and a more extensive vocabulary.  © 2023 IEEE."

However, a recently discovered vulnerability in the Apache webserver has raised serious concerns, potentially allowing hackers to gain remote access to devices worldwide. The imminent danger of exploitation is further heightened by the fact that malicious actors are already attempting to exploit this vulnerability. By leveraging a script embedded within a targeted log message, attackers have been successful in gathering LDAP information, enabling them to execute access attacks on the server without the need for login credentials. These attacks involve several stages, including intelligence collection, weaponization, attack delivery, exploitation, and ultimately breaching the system by installing the intended malware or malicious payload.

This is because installing a massive 5G network requires a large investment by network providers. For this reason, the authors propose an alternative beyond 5G that has better quality than 5G and a relatively lower investment value than 5G networks. This study aims to analyze the downlink of the cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network, which is usually used in 5G, combined with the use of a reconfigurable intelligence surface (RIS) antenna with decode and forward relay mechanisms. RIS is processed with a limited number of objects utilizing Rayleigh fading channels. The scenario is created by a user who relays without a direct link for users near the base station and with a direct link for users far from the base station. Under the Nakagami-m fading channel, the authors carefully evaluated the probability of loss for various users as a function of perfect channel statistical information (p-CSI) utilizing simply a single input-output (SISO) system with a finite number of RIS elements. As a key success metric, the efficiency of the proposed RIS-assisted NOMA transmission mechanism is evaluated through numerical data on the outage probability for each user. The modeling outcomes demonstrate that the RIS-aided NOMA network outperforms the traditional NOMA network. © 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved."

The populist economic paradigm, known as “Koperasi” in Indonesia, has long existed. Nonetheless, Koperasi was unable to keep up with information and technology in the 4.0 industrial era. When other industrial models use information technology on a large scale, Koperasi appears to have difficulty abandoning the conventional paradigm. Slowly but surely, Koperasi is losing popularity, particularly among Generation Z, who considers digital technology an integral part of their daily lives. The breadth of Koperasi's business contracts and becomes constrained, as does the company's cash. In contrast, information technology offers chances to small and medium-sized businesses. The data indicates that this sector generates 60.5% of the national GDP, employs 96.9% of the entire labor force, and accounts for 99.9% of total employment. Unfortunately, a large number of Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSME) have limited money, and therefore tend to favor fintech services that provide quick accessibility over Koperasi.

The platform requirements are designed using the Software Requirements Specification and User Acceptance Test. As a result, an application is created to serve as a model platform for Koperasi and MSMEs.

The study used three primary pure hues of four different saturation and brightness levels and three color schemes that create color palettes. A total of thirty-six cards were used as stimuli for open-free and closed-sorting tasks. A thematic analysis was performed by exploring the word cloud using Nvivo12 software. The study revealed that uncommon colors can give a novel and modern impression as the color schemes are not often used on food packaging. The study has also shown what color palette to use and avoid by combining hues, saturation, and brightness in food packaging design to create certain functional or emotional values.

The first step in our research is to collect a dataset regarding IPS, which contains distance data to three beacons as well as the position of the mobile phone in the room and determines the location based on the two outputs, namely Position X and Position Y. Then we design knowledge distillation for DNN to realize the compression model. We prove our compressed model by comparing the student model with the teacher model and the student model without the teacher model. We use several test metrics, including accuracy, loss, number of model parameters (Params), and compression ratio (CR). The test results show that the accuracy of the student with the teacher model outperforms the student without the teacher model, namely 0.8 compared to 0.776 for Position X and 0.96 compared to 0.88 for Position Y.

However, existing research needs to examine further the imbalanced dataset that occurs in flood attacks, where these conditions can affect attack detection performance. Our research aim is to utilize the area under curve (AUC) maximization for flood attack detection on MQTT with imbalanced datasets. We leverage datasets from existing papers for flood attacks and legitimate network data. Then we utilize the AUC maximization methodology as follows: we perform parameter tuning of three machine learning methods: gradient boosting, naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). Then we measure the performance of each model with the receiver operating curve (ROC) and AUC. We repeated these steps by performing parameter tuning and feature selection until the optimum AUC was found. Our test results show that the f1-score test can be used in the majority class but gives poor results in the minority class. At the same time, AUC shows that gradient boosting is the optimum detection method compared to naive Bayes and KNN, with AUCs of 0.96, 0.86, and 0.77, respectively. Finally, testing with feature selection shows that feature selection can increase AUC and decrease training and testing time by reducing features from 33 to two, revealing that the prominent features in a flood attack are tcp.len and tcp.time_delta.  © 2023 IEEE."

Here, the GA optimization is used to determine the position of seven control points. The char-acterizations show that the initial configuration has the bandwidth response from the frequency of 3.08 GHz to more than 20 GHz, while the GA optimized one produces the bandwidth from the frequency of 2.86 GHz to more than 20 GHz. The decrease on the lower frequency yields an increase on the bandwidth ratio from 6.49: 1 to 6.99: 1. Thus, the proposed configuration produces the bandwidth enhancement from 215.6% to 226.6%.

This paper discusses performance evaluation on radiation characteristics of a Kaiser-based linear antenna array with small even variations of elements number (N), namely 1 × 4, 1× 6, and 1 × 8. The use of Kaiser function in weighting method will give significant sidelobe level (SLL) suppression and offer a flexibility by changing the value of β parameters. Moreover, the increase of N also affects the diminishment of width of main lobe (WML) value and provides almost constant front to back ratio (FBR) value. In 1×4 Kaiser-based linear antenna array, the radiation characteristics show the non-appearance of sidelobe, so the SLL suppression value is undetermined, whereas the WML and FBR values are 30° and 13.32 dB, respectively. The performance of a 1 × 6 Kaiser-based linear antenna array has the SLL suppression from -34.35 dB up to -33.73 dB, WML of 25°, and FBR of 13.36 dB.

PLO contains several autonomous agents that represent the solution. The best solution represents collective intelligence, i.e., the leader. PLO has distinct mechanics in finding the acceptable solution during the given iteration. Every agent moves to a specified target in every iteration. Two options can be chosen to determine the target. First, the target is calculated by pushing the virtual best solution away from the corresponding agent. Second, the target is randomly chosen within the solution space. This target selection is conducted stochastically based on the threshold that is set manually before the iteration. Then, several candidates are generated between the target and the agent's current location. The distance between adjacent candidates is the same. The agent moves to the best candidate and updates the best solution. Simulation is implemented to observe and analyze the PLO’s performance. The well-known 23 benchmark functions are used as the optimization problems. In this simulation, PLO is benchmarked with marine predator algorithm (MPA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), average subtraction-based optimizer (ASBO), slime mold algorithm (SMA), and pelican optimization algorithm (POA). The result shows that PLO is competitive compared to these algorithms, especially in solving fixed-dimension multimodal functions.

Gas pressure, temperature, flowrate, and gas properties must be monitored during the transmission process. These variables, also known as operational conditions, need to be simulated carefully to understand the dynamics and behavior over time. Commonly used physical equations, such as thermodynamic or hydraulic equations, have limitations in simulating future trends because they need some known boundary conditions to be solved. In that case, data-driven method is needed, especially nowadays when data management is widely implemented. This paper implements a deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to forecast the future behavior of gas pressure as an operational condition in a gas pipeline network receiving platform. Different types of recurrent cells are used, i.e., Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The model is trained in 8 years of a gas pipeline network operational data. Historical flowrate data in the end-nodes become the forecast input in addition to the past pressure data. The sensitivity of the model and learning parameters is experimented with and analyzed to understand the capacity of the RNN in the given task. Mean absolute error is set as the satisficing metric, whereas the training time is set as optimizing metrics. The obtained best model successfully forecasts the future pressure of one day ahead with only around 2% relative error. © IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License."

Employing passive infrared (PIR) and gas sensors is vulnerable to false alarms. Machine learning with camera-based convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a suitable solution. While there are many studies on this problem, they tend to focus only on detection accuracy without considering mobility. Employing an embedded system could improve mobility due to the device's small size. However, implementing the existing solution in embedded systems becomes challenging due to limited computation and memory. Therefore, there is room for improvement to develop a mobile device to prevent house fires. This research aims to create an indoor camera-based fire detection system using CNN in embedded systems. TensorFlow Lite serves as the framework for machine learning to run CNN, the Yolov5 Model as a fire detection pre-training model, and a Raspberry Pi 4 as a data processor and controller for this system. Our proposed approach can be executed on embedded systems. The test scenario involves installing the embedded systems with cameras in a room with fire and without fire and sampling 30 times in each test. From the tests conducted, our system's sensitivity (recall) is 83%, with a precision of 86% and an accuracy of 85%.

In the experiments, the flame images of all plates are captured at equivalence ratios of 0.8 to 1.2 using a Digital Single Lens Reflect camera. The flame temperatures are measured using the infra-red imaging technique while the emissions, burning chamber and stack temperature are also recorded using an emission gas analyzer and K-type thermocouples respectively.

The connection between sensors with other sensors is called Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). There can be some delay when the sensor communicates. The delay will affect message delivery. It can make the data will not be sent or maybe corrupted. So, clock synchronization is needed to remove the effects of random delays from the timing message transmissions sent across wireless channels. When communicating, the node will make some network called topology. The examples are star, mesh, etc. Different topologies may also affect the clock synchronization. This will also affect when delivering data. There are many types of protocols used in WSN such as the Average TimeSync Protocol. Average TimeSync Protocol is a protocol which synchronizes the clock speed and clock offset. It will be implemented using Matlab.

Digital signatures have been widely used in commercial systems, especially since the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced many people to do work from home, so they had to send documents between people digitally. Many digital signature algorithms have been proposed before, however, the most suitable algorithm for Portable Document Format (PDF) documents from the point of view of security and digital signature processing time are unknown. Apart from this, the available digital signature service systems are relatively expensive. To overcome this, this study proposes an analysis of digital signature algorithms in terms of security, memory usage, and processing time on PDF documents.

However, companies also require a consistently available network to ensure uninterrupted business processes, so First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP) can be used as a solution for the availability aspect of the network. In previous research, the implementation of the DMVPN network used one of the FHRP protocols, namely HSRP, so this research was conducted to test the DMVPN network using other FHRP protocols, namely VRRP and GLBP using a star topology with a variation of Dual HUB to test network redundancy using evaluation metrics of network convergence time and Quality of Service (QoS) in the form of throughput, delay and packet loss. The results of QoS testing on sending TCP packets using GLBP on the DMVPN network are better based on throughput, delay, and packet loss. This is due to the load-balancing feature in GLBP. However, in UDP packet transmission, it was found that the use of VRRP on the DMVPN network was better than using GLBP based on the results of throughput, delay, packet loss and network convergence time. This happens because the load-balancing feature on GLBP does not work on UDP packet transmission and network convergence time when the primary router has a problem, VRRP is faster with 3.58 seconds compared to GLBP which takes 9.56 seconds.  © 2023 IEEE."

A high inflation rate encourages a country to raise its interest rate, which on the other hand has a risk of limiting economic growth and increasing the possibility of a country's recession. With so many uncertainties in macroeconomics in the future, this could result in excessive public concern. So, a time series model that can predict fluctuations in Indonesia's inflation rate is very needed. Therefore, this study proposes forecasting Indonesia's inflation using the Vector Autoregression (VAR) method by involving an interest rate dataset based on a strong Granger relationship from interest rates to inflation. The VAR model is used because the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) value obtained is the smallest among other Vector Autoregression Moving Average (VARMA) models, indicating it to be the most optimal model in terms of both goodness of fit and model complexity.

There are two direction-based searches performed in every iteration where each search produces a single child.

Research about forest fire prediction and its impact has been abundant. However, there still needs to be more people's awareness of the hazard and risks. This study introduces an interactive simulation tool to help society and scientists from other fields understand better the risk of climate-related fire in Borneo. The interactive simulator of forest fire prediction is created as a web-based application using the Flask framework and Bokeh library in Python. As the first development, it visualizes the historical spatial and temporal forest and land fire data over Borneo, computed by machine learning methods, namely Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machine. The prediction results show that the three models similarly predict burned areas. Meanwhile, Random Forest predicts the carbon emission slightly better than other models, with 4.751 and 0.008 for MAE and NRMSE, respectively. It also gives interactive features that the user can play to estimate the fires, given climate and environmental conditions.  © 2023 IEEE."

Blockage of blood vessels is one of the causes of myocardial infarction. MI causes blood flow to the heart to become blocked. In the worst case, it causes cardiac death. In general, the screening of cardiovascular disease can be performed using an electrocardiogram (ECG), phonocardiogram (PCG), and photoplethysmogram (PPG). Among these three signals, PCG detection is rarely used in MI detection. In fact, PCG signal has advantages such as non-invasive, efficient, and low-cost. Deep learning is also one of the methods used by many previous researchers to classify an object. However, from several previous research, the implementation of deep learning algorithms on PCG signals, especially in cases of myocardial infarction, has yet to be carried out. As a solution to the problem, this research proposes developing a deep-learning model to predict myocardial infarction based on PCG signals. This research uses the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to classify PCG signal data. PCG signal data was obtained from Hasan Sadikin Hospital Bandung, Indonesia.

The proposed EM wave absorber configuration is mainly constructed by an array of 2-dimensionally grounded open ring resonators on a dielectric substrate. The varactor diode with varied reverse direct current (DC) bias voltages is loaded into the open ring resonator of EM wave absorber configuration for achieving the tunable frequency operation. As the basic pattern, a unit cell of 1.5mm width open ring resonator is configured on a 1.6mm thick FR4 epoxy dielectric substrate with the dimension of 25mm × 25mm. The characteristics of varactor diode loaded open ring resonator are analyzed through its equivalent circuit, whereby its consists of an inductor connected in series with a shunt capacitor which is connected in parallel with a series of resistor and junction capacitor. Here, the values of junction capacitor are set from 2.67 pF to 0.63 pF which correspond to the reverse DC bias voltage of varactor diode. By using those junction capacitor values, the EM wave absorber yields the tunable frequency operation from 2.54 GHz to 2.70 GHz with varied reflection coefficient values from -12.81 dB to -18.89 dB, respectively.

Each video has a variety of scenarios such as various video resolutions and FPS, the number of moving objects other than fire, environmental lighting conditions, angles, and video capture times. Our experiment result showed the average accuracy of the proposed system reached 86.61%.  © 2023 IEEE."

It stimulated the repressive action of the Jokowi government has made Indonesian democracy to be on decline. Some scholars consider this as an atavism of an entrenching ideological conflict since hundreds of years ago between nationalism vs. Islamism. However, we argue that polarisation is more complex than what we expected before. This article examines the Islamist grassroots discourses to get an alternative perspective regarding the resurrection of conservatism in Indonesia. We collected and analysed qualitatively data of internet memes during the 2019 Indonesia Presidential campaign. We argue that antagonism occurred among the Islamist sectarian groups as a continuation of the Aksi Bela Islam (The Defending Islam Movement) in 2016. The antagonism among the groups indicates the rise of the Islamic radical-conservatism groups through the presentation of the antagonism between Islam Nusantara and Islamist puristic movement. The Islamic radical-conservatism group has successfully exploited the anti-Ahok movement with the Bela Islam (defending Islam) discourse. However, using Islamist issues during the 2019 presidential election has represented the triumph of the Politics of Islam: Islamization of Indonesian political ideology. Islam has harmonised into nationalism and secularism despite the internet memes' incoherent and irrational language. The triumph of Islamic hegemony transformed and infected Indonesia's political ideology. Islam has become an obligatory symbol in Indonesian politics. © 2023, Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

Researchers have developed NDN-based networks in recent years in an attempt to overcome the limitations of the TCP/IP architecture. Named data networks using content names involve many things, including routing. Although NDN has a routing protocol, the current problem is that it has high overhead because the routing used by NDN is currently decentralized, where each synchronization and path update process uses broadcast packet delivery. To reduce broadcasts and reduce the overhead of creating a controller where the controller has a separate signaling path from the data path. How to combine NDN with centralized control and design the overall architecture to achieve good performance and overhead has been done by many previous researchers. However, the development process still relies heavily on IP. So in this paper, we propose an NDN Centralized Routing that runs on top of NDN. It only forwards packets of named packets by eliminating the IP of routers to communicate. This paper also compares the Centralized Routing system and the Decentralized Routing system. As a result, the overhead generated by centralized routing is lower when compared to decentralized routing.  © 2023 IEEE."

To address this issue, we propose a system that can recommend a personal travel itinerary within a few days of tour visit. We can consider that determining a tourist route is the same as finding the optimal solution to the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Various algorithms can be used to solve TSP, including the Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm (CSO). In our research, we develop a system that can generate optimal recommendations for scheduling tourist routes in Yogyakarta using the CSO algorithm by combining the concept of Multi-Attribute Utility Theory to meet the needs of users based on various criteria such as ratings, cost, and time. Our experiment uses Simulated Annealing (SA) as the base model. The proposed method showed that the CSO algorithm performed better than the SA in optimality and computational efficiency. Specifically, the CSO algorithm produced itineraries that are 1.67% more optimal than SA when considering multi-criteria and faster than SA in computation time when considering single-criteria.

Meanwhile, most people still do not understand about the technical features. In this study, we develop CRS using the CRS framework based on high-level requirements that is proposed by previous works. In this study, we call this high-level requirements as functional requirements. An example of a functional requirement is, ""a user wants a smartphone to play ultra-mode games without having to know the required specifications"". The CRS framework consists of ontology and the agent for generating interaction. Ontology acts as the knowledge that maps functional requirements to technical specifications of the product.

Given the economic burden it may impose on the population, this condition must be taken seriously. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is the gold standard for diagnosing osteoporosis (DEXA). However, due to its high cost, non-portability, and radiation risk, DEXA cannot be applied to large populations. An alternative method for evaluating bone quality is ultrasound. It is more affordable, portable, and has no radiation risk. In this preliminary study, an A-mode ultrasound spectroscopy prototype for assessing the density of a 3D-printed bone model is designed. A single-element transducer (Transmit-Tx/Receive-Rx), a reconfigurable and modular FPGA-based ultrasound beamformer system, and a Raspberry Pi 3 are the system's control units. The raw radio frequency (RF) signal is acquired from three variations of density of the 3D-printed bone model, i.e., 100%, 60%, and 40%, to represent normal bone, osteopenia, and osteoporosis. The designed prototype can adequately characterize the mechanical wave scattering pattern of the 3D-printed bone model indicated by the increased tendency in the maximum amplitude when the density of the bone model is increasing. The tendency is the opposite for delay time and Power Spectral Density (PSD). These three signal parameters are potential candidate parameters to represent bone density. For future work, the selected candidate parameters can later be used as reference values while adding a significant data so that a machine learning method can be employed to extract representative features of bone density level, i.e., normal bone, osteopenia, and osteoporosis. © 2023, North Atlantic University Union NAUN.

Presently, these measurements are carried out manually using markers, which is a time-consuming process and prone to errors. This paper presents a computer vision-based system for detecting shoulder and knee abnormalities by automatically measuring shoulder tilt and knee distance to observe the knock-knees and bowlegs condition. The proposed system employs deep learning and BlazePose landmark estimation to accurately identify anomalies in the shoulders and legs. The Atan and Dist theoretical basis is applied for shoulder tilt and knee distance measurements, respectively. The proposed system can measure shoulder tilt and knee distance with an error rate of less than 10%. The automation of these measurements reduces the time required for examination and eliminates subjectivity and potential errors associated with manual measurements. Therefore, the proposed system has the potential to revolutionize shoulder and knee abnormality examinations by offering more accurate and efficient diagnoses.  © 2023 IEEE."

In tourism, deep relationships can be built based on valuable and meaningful travel experiences in sustainable tourism destinations. The aim of the study is an examination of tourist engagement for loyalty in the sustainable destination image. This research was designed through a causal study. ASurvey for data collection was conducted employing questionnaires specifically designed for local tourists visiting tourist villages in Bali and Yogyakarta. A sample of 282 local tourists was determined incidentally according to established criteria. Data analysis used statistical inference analysis, namely Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) maximum likelihood method. The research findings indicate that the alignment of values demonstrated in the image of sustainable tourist villages encourages tourists to engage in and support sustainability. The congruence of normative values and beliefs portrayed by the brand image as a tourist village fosters intentions to revisit and recommend it to others. Tourists’ behaviors further contribute to sustainability based on normative considerations of tourist village sustainability. The theoretical implication is the congruence of values as a concept that cannot be separated from consumer engagement and sustainable tourism destinations. Values developed based on tourists’ self-congruence with sustainability form the basis of relationships with tourists. These values become the primary preferences for engagement and loyalty to sustainability. By understanding self-congruence theory, managers can design strategies that consider the values and attributes the target market identifies in sustainable tourism destinations. Creating value congruence between the destination and the tourist’s self-image can encourage emotional engagement and tourist preference for sustainable destinations. © 2023 The Author(s).

SMO imitates the behaviour of two magnets close to each other: pushing toward or pulling away from each other. This pushpull mechanism is then adopted to become a novel search in SMO. SMO is set up as a swarm of magnets that move autonomously. In the early iteration, the pull strategy is dominant. Meanwhile, it declines during the iteration and is replaced by a push strategy. The determination between these two strategies is calculated stochastically. SMO consists of three sequential phases in every iteration where the corresponding magnet and its reference run a push or pull search in each phase. The reference used in each phase is the global best magnet, a randomly selected magnet, and a randomly generated magnet. This paper evaluates SMO through simulation to find the optimal solution for 23 functions. The performance of SMO is compared with five latest metaheuristics: mixed leader-based optimizer (MLBO), guided pelican algorithm (GPA), zebra optimization algorithm (ZOA), coati optimization algorithm (COA), and clouded leopard optimizer (CLO). The result shows that SMO is better than MLBO, GPA, ZOA, COA, and CLO in consecutively 22, 15, 11, 13, and 14 functions. The superiority of SMO, especially, is in solving high dimension functions. Meanwhile, in the fixed-dimension multimodal functions, SMO is still superior to MLBO but less superior to GPA, ZOA, COA, and CLO. © 2023, International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems.

Therefore, the early identification of this disease is crucial. However, the primary issue of microarray is the curse of dimensionality. This problem is related to the characteristic of microarray data, which has a small sample size yet many attributes. Moreover, this problem could lower the accuracy of cancer detection systems. Various machines and deep learning techniques have been researched to solve this problem. This paper implemented a deep learning method named Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) to build the Lung Cancer detection system. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used to extract features, and recurrent neural networks (RNN) are used to summarize the derived features. CNN and RNN methods are combined in CRNN to derive the advantages of each of the methods. Several previous research uses CRNN to build a Lung Cancer detection system using medical image biomarkers (MRI or CT scan). Thus, the researchers concluded that CRNN achieved higher accuracy than CNN and RNN independently. Moreover, CRNN was implemented in this research by using a microarray-based Lung Cancer dataset. Furthermore, different drop-out values are compared to determine the best drop-out value for the system. Thus, the result shows that CRNN gave a higher accuracy than CNN and RNN. The CRNN method achieved the highest accuracy of 91%, while the CNN and RNN methods achieved 83% and 71% accuracy, respectively. © 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved."

There are two novel mechanics regarding this proposed metaheuristic. First, there are multiple interactions and movements during the guided search carried out by every agent in every iteration. Second, there are two references in every interaction: the global best solution and a randomly chosen solution. Meanwhile, a random search within the space is carried out by any agent that fails to improve its own solution after several consecutive trials. In this work, MIDLO is tested to solve 23 classic functions so that its performance can be evaluated. In this test, MIDLO is competed with five swarm-based metaheuristics: particle swarm optimization (PSO), stochastic marine predator algorithm with multiple candidates (SMPA-MC), golden search optimizer (GSO), average and subtraction-based optimizer (ASBO), and guided pelican algorithm (GPA). The result indicates that MIDLO is better than these sparing metaheuristics, especially in optimizing the high-dimension functions. Overall, MIDLO is better than PSO, SMPA-MC, GSO, ASBO, and GPA in solving 20, 12, 15, 9, and 13 functions respectively.

The findings showed that the central government grant, locally generated revenue, and human capital development positively influenced regional economic growth, although the degree of decentralisation negatively affected regional growth. Meanwhile, for regions with independence above 50 per cent, decentralisation, locally generated revenue, central government transfer and provincial loans and human capital development positively influenced regional economic growth. In addition, findings also indicated that a dynamic effect exists, implying that the performance of previous regional economic growth influenced current economic achievements.

The research introduces four features which are extracted from the red pixel and edge map. The algorithm to extract the features has also been developed. They are applied to three commonly used classifiers: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers to validate the effectiveness of the features. Since the public dataset related to the research is not available yet, the nighttime videos from YouTube have been collected. The datasets contain all the various levels of darkness. They are divided into an 80-20 ratio for training and testing sets to support the experiment and measure the validity of the proposed method.

The purpose of this study is to comprehend the formation of a new style of totem related to symbols and meanings that change the value system in the audience so as forming exclusivism. This study focuses on the advertisement for Tolak Angin with the figure of Rhenald Kasali. The research was conducted using the semiotic research method of Roland Barthes’ structural model with descriptive-interpretative techniques by analyzing the structure of the advertising text starting from denotation and connotation which then carried out a semiotic process through the relationships between signs to myths. This study found that Tolak Angin uses Rhenald Kasali as the totem of the advertisement with the meaning of “smart person”. Rhenald Kasali represents a group of people who consider themselves smart. Totem makes a symbol of value system that unite consumers or society, this power will later form “exclusivism” in a group that forms a certain class that has the same attachment to the product “Tolak Angin” with the totem as “smart people”.

The noncontact measurement method is preferable in practice, and the radar system is potentially employed for developing displacement measurement technology. Frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar has a feature for detecting the target location. However, estimating the small displacement in the bridge structure requires extensive bandwidth to reach the proper resolution. The problem of obtaining the required resolution, and adopting the decrease in accuracy due to several possible radar placements during measurement are addressed in this article. The concept of bridge displacement measurement using a modified FMCW radar system is proposed. Phase information extraction is employed to reach the displacement detection resolution, and the radar elevation detection based on an inclinometer is equipped in the proposed radar system. The simulation and laboratory experiments were conducted by implementing the proposed radar system for detecting the displacement in the bridge model. The experiment results confirm that the proposed FMCW radar was able to estimate the bridge displacement and overcome the decreasing accuracy due to the radar elevation. The multipoint detection technique is also developed in the proposed radar and is capable to capture the displacement profile over the bridge span. The proposed FMCW system is then recommended as a radar system in developing a noncontact method for bridge displacement measurement and monitoring.  © 1963-2012 IEEE."

Recent research in this field focuses on identifying effective ways to capture the long-term contextual dependencies of speech signals to enhance performance. Deep convolutional networks (DCN) using self-attention and the Transformer model have demonstrated competitive results in SE. Transformer models with convolution layers can capture short and long-term temporal sequences by leveraging multi-head self-attention, which allows the model to attend the entire sequence. This study proposes a neural speech enhancement (NSE) using the convolutional encoder-decoder (CED) and convolutional attention Transformer (CAT), named the NSE-CATNet. To effectively process the time-frequency (T-F) distribution of spectral components in speech signals, a T-F attention module is incorporated into the convolutional Transformer model. This module enables the model to explicitly leverage position information and generate a two-dimensional attention map for the time-frequency speech distribution. The performance of the proposed SE is evaluated using objective speech quality and intelligibility metrics on two different datasets, the VoiceBank-DEMAND Corpus and the LibriSpeech dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed SE outperformed the competitive baselines in terms of speech enhancement performance at -5dB, 0dB, and 5dB. This suggests that the model is effective at improving the overall quality by 0.704 with VoiceBank-DEMAND and by 0.692 with LibriSpeech. Further, the intelligibility with VoiceBank-DEMAND and LibriSpeech is improved by 11.325% and 11.75% over the noisy speech signals.  © 2013 IEEE."

Data were gathered through observations and interviews with tourists, mosque managers, traders, and local community members. The findings suggest that the Great Mosque of Demak's construction prioritizes functional components over aesthetics, as seen in the mosque's places for prayer, education, tourism, business, and socio-cultural activities. The Great Mosque of Demak has also been designed by emphasizing semantic aspects, as evidenced by the usage of ornaments from three civilizations at once, Islam, Hinduism, and Java. They occur in both the interior and the exterior of the mosque. Acculturation at the Great Mosque of Demak is not only seen in building designs that use a variety of architectural designs, namely Islamic, Javanese, Hindu, and modern, but also contributes to developing socio-cultural aspects and improving the local community's economy through conserving traditions, ornamentation, and tourism. As a predecessor to the development of Islam in Java, the Great Mosque of Demak can change from time to time to become a historical, cultural, and religious building, a symbol of glory and tolerance among the religious communities. © Scopus Indexed Since 2016"

Automatic proctoring has been developed to mitigate this issue, but security vulnerabilities related to impersonation detection using virtual webcams still exist. To address this issue and improve the reliability and accuracy of face verification technology, we propose a novel method that focuses on similarity scores generated from face recognition. Our proposed algorithm captures student activity during an exam every 5 seconds and compares it with the profile picture on the Learning Management System (LMS). The comparison results are converted into quantitative data and represented in a table and a graph. Each repetition of the similarity score values is compared with subsequent iterations over 15 iterations, automatically detecting potential impersonation cases and upholding the integrity of student assessments. The proposed algorithm ensures that a user is a valid user before activating the cheating detection pipeline, providing a comprehensive and efficient solution for detecting potential cheating incidents in online exams. This method represents a significant advancement in face recognition technology, with the capacity to confirm a user's identity before activating the cheating detection pipeline. In conclusion, our proposed method provides a promising approach to combat impersonation attacks in online exams, ensuring academic integrity and fairness. By automating the process of comparing similarity score values, the proposed algorithm offers a rapid and reliable method for detecting potential impersonation cases and improving the effectiveness of automatic proctoring systems.

Information security in the health industry is crucial because it involves comprehensive and strategic information that might harm human life. The human factor is one of the biggest security threats to HIS. Objective: This study aims to investigate the information security behavior (ISB) of HIS users using a comprehensive assessment scale suited to the information security concerns in health care. Patients are increasingly being asked to submit their own data into HIS systems. As a result, this study examines the security behavior of health workers and patients, as well as their demographic variables. Methods: We used a quantitative approach using surveys of health workers and patients. We created a research instrument from 4 existing measurement scales to measure prosecurity and antisecurity behavior. We analyzed statistical differences to test the hypotheses, that is, the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney test. The descriptive analysis was used to determine whether the group exhibited exemplary behavior when processing the survey results. A correlational test using the Spearman correlation coefficient was performed to establish the significance of the relationship between ISB and age as well as level of education. Results: We analyzed 421 responses from the survey. According to demographic factors, the hypotheses tested for full and partial security behavior reveal substantial differences. Education levels most significantly affect security behavior differences, followed by user type, gender, and age. The health workers’ ISB is higher than that of the patients. Women are more likely than men to engage in prosecurity actions while avoiding antisecurity behaviors. The older the HIS user, the more likely it is that they will participate in prosecurity behavior and the less probable it is that they will engage in antisecurity behavior. According to this study, differences in prosecurity behavior are mostly impacted by education level. Higher education, on the other hand, does not guarantee improved ISB for HIS users. All demographic characteristics, particularly concerning user type, show discrepancies that are caused mainly by antisecurity behavior rather than prosecurity behavior. Conclusions: Since patients engage in antisecurity behavior more frequently than health workers and may pose security risks, health care facilities should start to consider information security education for patients. More comprehensive research on ISB in health care facilities is required to better understand the patient’s perspective, which is currently understudied. © 2023 JMIR Medical Education.

Like other plants in general, potato plants also have diseases; if this disease is not treated immediately, there will be a significant decrease in food production. Therefore, it is necessary to detect diseases quickly and precisely so that disease control can be carried out effectively and efficiently. Classification of potato leaf disease can be done directly. Still, the symptoms cannot always explain the type of disease that attacks potato leaves because there are many types of diseases with symptoms that look the same. Humans also have deficiencies in determining the results of identification of potato leaf disease, so sometimes the results of identification between individuals can be different. Therefore, the use of Deep Learning for the classification process of potato leaf disease is expected to shorten the time and have a high classification accuracy. This study uses a deep learning method with the DenseNet201 architecture. The choice to use the DenseNet201 algorithm in this study is because the model can identify important features of potato leaves and recognize early signs of emerging diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the transfer learning method with the DenseNet201 architecture in increasing the classification accuracy of potato leaf disease compared to traditional classification methods. This study uses two types of scenarios, namely, comparing the number of dropouts and comparing the three optimizers. This test produces the best model using dropout 0.1 and Adam optimizer with an accuracy of 99.5% for training, 95.2% for validation, and 96% for the confusion matrix.

According to the previous study, automatic text summarization in Bahasa Indonesia is still challenging due to research in this area, especially the research which discusses TextRank algorithm performance, which is still meagerly. Accordingly, this research observes the performance of the TextRank algorithm to summarize the text in Bahasa Indonesia. The TextRank algorithm summarizes a text by sorting out the essential words and relevant sentences regardless of the source language. This algorithm uses a vertex to represent a word. The similarity measurement process will calculate the overlapping words (the same word between two vertices). These overlapping words are represented by the edge, which connects the vertices. Thus, the text forms a graph. This research focuses on the similarity measurement process to determine relevant sentences in a text. As the similarity measurement is critical for the summarization result, this research switches the original process to the Levenshtein Distance algorithm and observes its performance. This research uses the human-produced summarized text by the expert in Bahasa Indonesia linguistics to evaluate the result. The evaluation method is conducted by using ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2. The result shows that the average of ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 for the TextRank algorithm is 0.439 and 0.3186, respectively. Meanwhile, the modified TextRank obtains 0.3999 and 0.2805, respectively.

The famous Support Vector Machine (SVM) uses the classification method to separate two data classes. The experimental results showed that the local feature HOG method was the fastest in the training process. However, the most accurate result was using the MobileNetV2 deep feature method with an accuracy of 98%. Deep features produced the best accuracy because the feature extraction process went through many neural network layers.

It makes the novel strategy of these metaheuristics difficult to investigate. Moreover, many metaheuristics use high iteration or swarm size in their first introduction. Based on this consideration, this work proposes a new metaheuristic free from metaphor. This metaheuristic is called treble search optimizer (TSO), representing its main concept in performing three searches performed by each member in each iteration. These three searches consist of two directed searches and one random search. Several seeds are generated from each search. Then, these searches are compared with each other to find the best seed that might substitute the current corresponding member. TSO is also designed to overcome the optimization problem in the low iteration or swarm size circumstance. In this paper, TSO is challenged to overcome the 23 classic optimization functions. In this experiment, TSO is compared with five shortcoming metaheuristics: slime mould algorithm (SMA), hybrid pelican komodo algorithm (HPKA), mixed leader-based optimizer (MLBO), golden search optimizer (GSO), and total interaction algorithm (TIA). The result shows that TSO performs effectively and outperforms these five metaheuristics by making better fitness scores than SMA, HPKA, MLBO, GSO, and TIA in overcoming 21, 21, 23, 23, and 17 functions, consecutively. The result also indicates that TSO performs effectively in overcoming unimodal and multimodal problems in the low iteration and swarm size. © 2023, IIUM Engineering Journal. All Rights Reserved."

Typical risk assessments, on the other hand, which produce a list of risk scenarios, more often than not, do not result in enough information for mitigations when it comes to resource limitations such as financial, time, or in this case: delays. Multi-attribute risk assessments give a solid foundation to develop systematic quantitative risk measurements that organizations can use for security mitigations. This study proposes a multi-level and multi-attribute risk assessment method that can be used to prepare mitigations in organization-wide or specific sections of a company. This study presents the evaluation process and results from a case study of a container terminal to evaluate delay risks in its dwelling time processes and to prepare requirements on mitigations based on the risk projections. The proposed method in this study mainly operates within the risk evaluation stage in the risk management lifecycle to complement other methods such as FMEA, FTA, and DEMATEL, which mainly operate within the risk identification and risk analysis stages of risk management. The evaluations in this case study address the efficiency of business process risk factors in a container terminal, not the safety-related risk factors. The proposed method takes event logs from information systems as input to evaluate the risk performances by computing the attributes of the event data. The method also offers risk projections to be treated as a reference to plan for mitigations and determine the likelihood of risk factors. The evaluation results from this case study have provided insights for operation managers and management to perceive and address risks within TPS Surabaya container terminal's business processes.

However, most studies have focused on predicting the risk of heart disease at a single point in time, and there is a need for a model that can predict the long-term risk of heart disease. This study aims to address this gap by comparing the performance of eight different ML algorithms for predicting heart disease over one, two, and three-year periods.

Several studies employed traditional machine learning to address the key security challenge, namely anomaly detection in IoT devices. Such models, however, require transmitting sensitive IoT data to a central model for training and validation which introduces security and performance concerns. In this paper, we propose a federated learning approach for detecting anomalies in IoT devices. We present our FedGroup model and algorithms that train and validate local models based on data from a group of IoT devices. FedGroup also updates the learning of the central model based on the learning changes that result from each group of IoT devices, rather than computing the average learning of each device. Our empirical evaluation of the real IoT dataset demonstrates the capability of our FedGroup model and anomaly detection accuracy as the same or better than federated and non-federated learning models. FedGroup is also more secure and performs well given all the IoT data are used to train and update the models locally. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The IPA method was then improved by focusing on the competitor’s side of the competitor’s position to plan a management strategy, namely Simultaneous IPA (SIPA). The traditional SIPA does not discuss item weights between criteria, so the criteria for the most significant improvement often cannot be seen. Therefore, the adjusted SIPA calculates the weight of each indicator multiplied by performance and importance score to gain the perfect result. Based on the results, the adjusted SIPA model has been implemented on E-government problems in Indonesia. The importance of quadrant II requires local governments to improve the existing problems. Performance matrix items are neglected opportunities and competitive disadvantages. In the first quadrant, the importance and performance of both local governments are equally high, but it needs to maintain its performance in direct competition. The low priority quadrant III position has no opportunity and is full of false alarms. According to the experimental results, the item in the second quadrant is the part that the Meranti Islands Regency needs to improve mainly in the service domain, Q32-Q39, Q46, Q47, especially in the governance domain (Q13). These items are considerably harder than those of high importance but with low power. The gap analysis results show that the central government’s rating score is lower than the self-assessment rate. This phenomenon indicates that expectations are higher than performance, and governments need to improve performance to match their value with profits. The gap analysis results between the two districts show that the gap between the two municipalities is negative overall and that the Meranti Island needs to improve all aspects of the E-government maturity assessment. A comparison of the SIPA and adjusted SIPA methods using the Wilcoxon method shows that there is an effect between changes in the two approaches, or in other words, the SIPA method was successfully improved using adjusted SIPA. © 2023 University of Bahrain.

The Sentence Transformer Model quantifies the degree of alignment between the UCD and FR by analyzing semantic similarity. According to the findings, modifications to the UCD, such as refining terminology, elucidating definitions, and correcting writing errors, can substantially increase semantic similarity with the FR. The Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.70 indicates the correlation between the predicted and the ground truth of semantic similarity is linearly positive. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient value of 0.715 suggests a positive monotonic relationship, with the two text types maintaining their rank of semantic similarity. The low mean squared error (MSE) value of 0.024 demonstrates the model's predictive accuracy for semantic similarity.  © 2023 IEEE."

Vision-based approaches could violate occupants’ privacy and wearable sensors based approaches could be intrusive with their daily activities. In this study, we proposed an NLP-based feature encoding for HAR in smart homes by using the Word2Vec word embedding model and incorporating location information of occupants. We used the NLP approach to generate semantic and automatic features directly from the raw data that significantly reduced the workload of feature encoding. The results showed that both Word2Vec embedding and location-enhanced sequences can significantly improve the classification performance. Our best model which used both Word2Vec embedding and location-enhanced sequences achieved an accuracy of 81% and a weighted average F1 score of 77% on the test data with Sensor Event Windows (SEW) size of 25. This size is considered as a small SEW size which can be applied better to real-time classification due to the short latency. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

This fact is so harmful to all parties. Hence, a fake news detector is required to tackle the problem. In this research, a Transformer-based fake news detection system is created. First, an architecture is designed using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). Three augmentation methods namely spell-checking-based, acronym-based, and typography-based augmentations are then developed to improve the BERT model. A comprehensive examination is performed based on 5-fold cross-validation using eleven thousand Twitter posts with four metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. Experimental results indicate that those three proposed augmentation methods can increase the BERT's performance detecting fake news related to Covid-19. The acronym-based augmentation gives a low improvement. Next, the spell-checking-based one provides a medium enhancement.

The high noise and volatility of the forex market make the traders very hard to open and close position accurately. Many approaches have been proposed to overcome these difficulties, including algorithmic trading. This research proposed a framework for algorithmic trading using Q-learning with the help of LSTM. The proposed framework uses a finite state space in reinforcement learning to use holding time and higher timeframe market data. The state space is designed so that the agent can open and close positions flexibly, without being restricted by a fixed time window. This allows the agent to take profits and avoid losses. The proposed framework was trained and tested using 15 years’ worth of historical data of the EUR/USD currency pair in 5-min timeframe data. The system was evaluated based on various metrics such as profit, drawdown, Sharpe ratio, holding time, and delta time. The results show that with its designed finite state space and flexible time window, the proposed framework achieved consistent profits, reduced losses, and increased overall profits.

A microstrip antenna with the characteristics of easy to manufacture and lightweight is suitable to meet these requirements. However, to support high data rates, it is necessary to increase the bandwidth of microstrip antennas, which usually have narrow bandwidth properties. The method used to increase the bandwidth of the microstrip antenna using a 1×2 configuration Complementary Split Ring Resonator (CSRR) on the ground plane has been investigated in this paper. The proposed antenna uses a circular ring patch and is designed on FR-4 material. From the unit cell simulation results, negative permittivity values are obtained in the frequency range 3.35 - 4 GHz or with a bandwidth of 650 MHz. The antenna simulation results show that by adding a CSRR with a 1×2 configuration, there is an increase in fractional bandwidth of 15.14% from 120 MHz to 650 MHz, compared to an antenna without a CSRR. The fabrication result bandwidth conforms with the simulation results with a bandwidth of 640 MHz.

We used random raw patch pairs from the SARA results to get a trained dictionary. In collecting the data for training, we used ten original images of the surrounding objects that we captured. Then we measured it using a VLBI sampling pattern, processed it using SARA, and applied the SARA results as a pre-reconstruction image.

One of the crucial elements in the soil for plant survival is soil water content (SWC). Radar system has advantages that can be implemented for measuring SWC in plantation areas. A radar system operates by utilizing electromagnetic waves to obtain the dielectric characteristics of the soil. However, the presence of tea plants has become an obstacle to the radar wave propagation toward the soil layer. Re ected signal, which is in uenced by the presence of vegetation, makes the estimation of SWC inaccurate. Consequently, the estimation of SWC needs to consider the vegetation's effect. This study uses an FMCW radar system, which operates at a frequency of 24 GHz. A layer medium propagation model is proposed in this study to prove the relationship between the re ected signal and the SWC. The re ection coefficient extracted from the radar signal is used to estimate the SWC. The vegetation propagation constant was obtained from the average field measurement results. The gravimetric method is used to validate the SWC estimation in vegetation's presence using the radar system.

Moreover, with personalization the norm in users’ lives and corporations collecting a multitude of sensitive data, it is increasingly important to profile users effectively while preserving their privacy. In this paper, we propose DeepProfile: a Multi-context Mobile Usage Patterns Framework for predicting contextually-aware clusters of mobile users and transition of clusters throughout time, based on their behaviors in three contexts - app usage, temporal and geo-spatial. Our DeepProfile framework preserves users’ privacy as it intelligently clusters their mobile usage patterns and their transition behaviors while maintaining users’ anonymity (i.e., without their gender, GPS location and high-level granularity application usage data). Our experimental results on a mobile app usage dataset show that the predicted user clusters have distinct characteristics in app usage, visited locations and behavioral characteristics over time. We found that on average, 18.6% to 23.6% of a cluster moves together to the next time segment, and other interesting insights such as over 90% of cluster transitions where users moved together, moved from a period of activity to inactivity at the same time. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

This paper proposes edge smart lighting (EdgeSL) architecture, an edge-computing architecture for real-time improved CIMA smart lighting control. We developed novel intelligent control using permutation importance feature selection to improve the CIMA algorithm. Three model compression methods for the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) model are compared, including the novel knowledge distillation on KNN called DistilKNN. The KNN model is the basis of CIMA. The method allows the model to run in an edge-computing environment. The experiment was carried out by evaluating processing time in three different environments, namely edge, fog, and cloud architecture. Our test results show that DistilKNN has the best accuracy compared to other methods, including pruning and quantization, which is 0.93.

In practice, the system dynamics parameters of the CubeSat 1U, such as the moment inertia and mass, are unknown. To handle the uncertainties of the parameters, the authors propose MRAC to control the yaw angle of the CubeSat 1U. The controller is designed and deployed using MATLAB, which is connected via Bluetooth to the CubeSat 1U. In the experiment, the communication delay occurs and causes deteriorated output response of standard MRAC. The modified MRAC and redesigned reference signal are used to reduce the time delay effect for the proposed controller. The numerical simulation and experiment are used to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller design. It is shown by modifying the standard MRAC and the reference signal, the system error can be reduced from +110-20 degrees to +10-10 degrees. © 2023 IEEE."

RCO provides a distinct mechanism regarding the diversification-intensification strategy. Each member runs two sequential activities in every iteration. The first activity is running and the second one is catching. Each activity generates a seed. In the first activity, a virtual best member moves away from the corresponding member to become the first seed. The second seed is generated along the way between the corresponding member and the first seed in the first activity. If both seeds fail to improve, the member conducts a random search to find a new member. Otherwise, the better seed replaces the corresponding member. Then, RCO is challenged to handle both theoretical and real-world optimization problems. The classic 23 functions represent theoretical problems, while the outsourcing optimization problem represents the practical problem. In these simulations, RCO is confronted with five other algorithms: grey wolf optimizer (GWO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), marine predator algorithm (MPA), Komodo mlipir algorithm (KMA), and pelican optimization algorithm (POA). The result shows that RCO is better than POA, KMA, MPA, GWO and PSO in optimizing 20, 21, 13, 12, and 21 functions consecutively.

The number of requests that are frequently requested makes internet network traffic only able to accommodate some user requests. A named data network (NDN) is here as a solution to overcome this problem. NDN changed the focus of the internet architecture, which was initially host-centric, to become content-centric. Caching on NDN router nodes can be used as a repository for passing content. Because IoT data always requires fresh data and real-time, one of the features in NDN called freshness can help maintain data freshness in the NDN router cache. This paper explores implementing the freshness method for content replacement decisions in the two cache replacement policies. Cache replacement policies are Least Recently Used (LRU) and First-in, first-out (FIFO). To validate the effectiveness of adding freshness-aware in the caching model, we run the emulation using an NDN emulator, Mini-NDN. The results show that freshness can maintain the freshness of data in IoT data and the performance of NDN caching with LRU policy increases based on parameters of the cache hit ratio and RTT compared to the FIFO policy. © 2023 IEEE."

The hydrothermal process was carried out at 90°C for 4 hours. Morphological characterization of ZnO nanostructures was conducted by using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The result produces a diameter of 60-80 nm and a length of 600-800 nm in the form of nanoflowers. The crystal and crystalline structure were studied with XRD, and it was shown that the ZnO nanostructure is a wurtzite structure in the form of a hexagonal shape and has a crystallite size of 59 nm. After conducting electrical characterization, it was shown that the current is directly proportional to the voltage, forming an ohmic contact curve. ZnO nanostructures have the potential to be applied as a gas sensor since the good response indicated the presence of butane gas. It is clarified that the nanostructure with a flow rate of 200 mL/min has a change in resistance of 0.17 MΩ/s with a recovery time of 30 seconds when it is exposed to butane gas for one minute.

Previous studies have a better understanding of consumer attitudes towards food packaging colours. However, few studies approached consumer attitudes from a design or art and humanities perspective. Using colour on package design allows small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to set a higher retail price and to create a premium look that is proper as a souvenir. This study uses a qualitative approach to discover the extent to which the perception of (un)common colours in packaging vary across two different consumer types. Methods One-on-one interviews were conducted to explore personal opinions. The purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used since this study focuses on tourists purchasing food souvenir products. This study involved small samples of 32 individuals (16 local tourists and 16 international travellers). During the interview, three sets of souvenir food packaging were shown to participants as stimuli. Data was coded with descriptive coding (open coding). Coding began by categorising the data using descriptive labels. The second analysis phase was the interpretive phase by axial coding. Results Both local and international groups perceived common and uncommon colours on packaging can create four functional values: brand searching and identification, colour strategy in branding, consumer attention, and brand positioning and competitive advantage. However, participants evaluated common and uncommon colours differently for emotional value creation. When more uncommon colours for both product categories and variants are used, additional perceptions may emerge. Additionally, the more common (congruent) colour, the more representative and informative the packaging design, which highlights the functional value. However, the uncommon colours give more emotional engagement. Conclusions There were differences in the functional value perception across two groups when common colour was applied to packaging. However, there was slight difference between two groups in the emotional value perception when applying the uncommon colour for packaging.

Hyperparameter optimization techniques are employed to ensure the model is trained with optimal input and batch size configurations. The findings demonstrate that the additional module successfully enhances the model's performance in detecting faults during the FDM 3D printing process. The best results are achieved using the YOLOv8s model with an image input size of 640 and a batch size of 16, achieving a mAPval (50-95) of 89.7%. Despite the increased complexity from additional layers, there is a favorable trade-off between performance and complexity. Furthermore, a testbed implementation is conducted to validate the model's performance in a real-world setting, showing that the fault detection latency remains insignificant even with multiple Raspberry Pi clients.

Therefore, an algorithm is needed that divides the power allocation for each user so that PD-NOMA can work optimally.

Many studies have been carried out to overcome this problem. On the other hand, future studies related to this problem are still available due to its complexity, circumstance, and methods. This work develops a new metaheuristic called a multiple interaction optimizer (MIO). MIO has distinct mechanics in finding the optimal solution. MIO consists of two phases. In the first phase, each agent interacts with some randomly selected agents in the population. The guided search is conducted in every interaction. In the second phase, each agent carries out a local search which linearly reduces the search space during the iteration. Three tests are carried out on the performance of MIO. In the first test, the MIO is challenged to solve 23 functions. The second test is performed as the investigation of the hyper parameters. In the third test, MIO is challenged to solve the order allocation problem with the objective is minimizing the total cost, total lateness, and total defect. In this test, MIO is benchmarked with five metaheuristics: particle swarm optimization (PSO), marine predator algorithm (MPA), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), slime mould algorithm (SMA), and golden search optimizer (GSO).

To complement that, rather than using the classic geometrical approach (such as multilateration), it uses a more data-driven approach, i.e., the location fingerprinting technique. The fingerprint of a location, in this case, is a set of Wi-Fi ToFs between the target device and an access point (AP). Therefore, the number of APs in the area dictates the set size. The location fingerprinting technique requires a collection of fingerprints of various locations in the area to build a reference database or map. This database or map contains the information used to carry out the main task of the location fingerprinting technique, namely, estimating the position of a device based on its location fingerprint. For that task, we propose using a fully connected deep neural network (FCDNN) model to act as a positioning engine. The model is given a location fingerprint as its input to produce the estimated location coordinates as its output. We conduct an experiment to analyze the impact of the available AP pair in the dataset, from 1 unique AP pair, 2 AP pairs, and more, using WKNN and FCDNN to compare their performance.

A normal ECG signal consisting of PQRST waves and an estimated heart rate can be used to diagnose arrhythmias. Manual examination of fetal arrhythmias is often impractical. Therefore, this study proposes a more effective and simple automatic detection system to detect fetal arrhythmias using segmentation of the ECG signal waveform in the form of PQRST waves with the One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) method.

Since aquatic stocks play a significant role in the daily diets of the surrounding populations, the present study used the ICP-MS technique to measure the levels of three natural radionuclides232 Th,238 U and40 K in three fish species collected from three locations along the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The activity concentration ranges from 23.13 ± 1.70 to 43.31 ± 2.10 Bq kg-1 for40 K, 0.06 ± 0.01 to 0.33 ± 0.05 Bq kg-1 for232 Th and 0.11 ± 0.08 to 0.48 ± 0.10 Bq kg-1 for238 U. The determined activity concentration of radionuclides was used to estimate the annual effective dose and cancer risk. The findings showed that the predicted yearly effective doses (µSv year-1) for232 Th,238 U and40 K were 1.67, 0.70, and 11.92 correspondingly, which were much lower than the UNSCEAR recommendation and considered to be safe. Based on the estimated annual effective dose and a life expectancy of 70 years, the cancer risk factor for adults is predicted to be 3.00 × 10-5. Compared to the UNSCEAR cancer risk factor of 8.4 × 10-3 and ICRP cancer risk factor of 3.5 × 10-3, this value is much lower. According to the current study, the dose that locals consume from eating fish is safe for human consumption, relatively minimal, and does not impair human health. © 2023, Malaysian Society of Analytical Sciences.

Distribution of medical images and EPR over public networks requires a high level of privacy and security. Robust and imperceptible watermarking techniques are needed to provide copyright preservation for medical images and protect patient information security. This paper improves the technique of Coltuc et al. by modifying the discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficient pairs in the watermark embedding formula. Our proposed formula ensures that the difference between the two coefficients is at least ζ. If the difference between the two coefficients is less than ζ, then the new pixels are modified so that the difference is equal to ζ. The proposed method was evaluated on a variety of medical images, including X-ray, CT, US, MRI, and Colonoscopy, and compared to numerous robust watermarking techniques of the recent time. The experimental results demonstrate that the suggested method outperforms contemporary robust watermarking techniques in terms of imperceptibility, robustness, and security. The peak signal noise ratio (PSNR) for all modalities of watermarked medical images exceeds 54 dB, and the average PSNR is approximately 56 dB. The proposed method is outstanding compared to Coltuc's method due to a 93% and 14% increase in bit error rate (BER) and normalized correlation (NC), respectively. Our work is superior to various state-of-the-art robust watermarking techniques, allowing it to be employed effectively in medical applications. © 2023,IIUM Engineering Journal. All Rights Reserved."

These threats can be prevented if the reader can verify the message's content integrity and source authenticity. One recent solution to overcome these threats was proposed by Ahvanooey et al. called ANiTW. ANiTW uses an invisible text watermarking scheme to verify social media message integrity and identify the message source. However, ANiTW is still vulnerable to undetected malicious text modification. Moreover, ANiTW has no tools to authenticate the extracted message source. The proposed method aims to overcome those vulnerabilities and improve ANiTW performance as a tool to verify message content integrity and message source authenticity in social media. To overcome vulnerabilities in ANITW, a part of the message hash and IBS-based signature is introduced as the watermark. The message integrity is verifiable by using part of the message hash as a watermark to detect any malicious. Moreover, implementing an IBS-based signature enables any reader to verify the message source's authenticity easily. In addition, to improve ANITW performance in embedding capacity and invisibility, a novel bigram-based character encoding and embedding rule are also introduced. Based on the experiment and analysis result, it is proven that the proposed method can perform better than ANiTW in the security, embedding capacity, and invisibility aspects.  © 2013 IEEE."

Business processes within the company continue to grow and cause them to run more complex. The large scale and complexity of business processes pose a challenge in improving the quality of process model because the effectiveness of time and the efficiency of existing resources are the biggest challenges. In the context of optimizing business processes with a process mining approach, most current process models are optimized with a trace clustering approach to explore the model and to perform analysis on the resulting process model. Meanwhile, in the event log data, not only the activities but also the other resources, such as records of employee or staff working time, process service time, and processing costs, are recorded. This article proposes a mechanism alternative to optimize business processes by exploring the resources that occur in the process. The mechanism is carried out in three stages. The first stage is optimizing the job shop scheduling method from the generated event log. Scheduling the time becomes a problem in the job shop. Utilizing the right time can increase the effectiveness of performance in order to reduce costs. Scheduling can be defined as the allocation of multiple jobs in a series of machines, in which each machine only does one job at a time. In general, scheduling becomes a problem when sequencing the operations and allocating them into specific time slots without prolonging the technical and capacity constraints. The second stage is generating the resource value that is recorded in the event log from the results of analysis of the previous stage, namely, job shop scheduling. The resource values are multivariate and then clustered to determine homogeneous clusters. The last stage is optimizing the nonlinear multipolynomials in the homogeneous cluster formed by using the Hessian solution. The results obtained are analyzed to get recommendations on business processes that are appropriate for the company's needs. The impact of long waiting times will increase service costs, but by improving workload, costs can be reduced. The process model and the value of service costs resulting from the mechanism in the research can be a reference for process owners in evaluating and improving ongoing processes.  © 2023 Hanung Nindito Prasetyo et al."

Competition in the education sector is characterized by the relevance of community needs, oriented to modernity with the principle of mutual justice, and substance oriented in harmony with global cooperation and competition. Educational competitiveness requires leadership support in improving and developing the quality of education (Waruwu et al., 2022). However, little is known about the support of visionary leadership and improving the quality of school competitiveness. This study aims to explore the support of visionary leadership and the quality of education on the competitiveness of schools. This study uses descriptive quantitative research methods to determine the average of each variable and continues with the correlational method. The instrument was a closed questionnaire distributed to 59 Islamic elementary schools in East Jakarta. The respondents are teachers and parents who are members of the school committee management team. A total of 481 respondents consisted of 222 teachers and 259 representatives of parents. The results showed that visionary leadership support, quality improvement, and school competitiveness were in the high category at private Islamic elementary schools in East Jakarta, Indonesia. All variables partially have a significant effect on school competitiveness.

Unfortunately, almost all metaheuristics are not equipped with an adaptive approach that makes them change their strategy when stagnation happens during iteration. Based on this consideration, a new metaheuristic, called an adaptive balance optimizer (ABO), is proposed in this paper. ABO's unique strategy focuses on exploitation when improvement happens and switching to exploration during stagnation. ABO also uses a balanced strategy between exploration and exploitation by performing two sequential searches, whatever circumstance it faces. These sequential searches consist of one guided search and one random search. Moreover, ABO also deploys both a strict acceptance approach and a non-strict acceptance approach. In this work, ABO is challenged to solve a set of 23 classic functions as a theoretical optimization problem and a portfolio optimization problem as the use case for the practical optimization problem. In portfolio optimization, ABO should optimize the quantity of ten stocks in the energy and mining sector listed in the IDX30 index. In this evaluation, ABO is competed with five other metaheuristics: marine predator algorithm (MPA), golden search optimizer (GSO), slime mold algorithm (SMA), northern goshawk optimizer (NGO), and zebra optimization algorithm (ZOA).

Using all available technology for disaster mitigation is critical for pandemic prevention and control. Recent studies have uncovered the advantage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or drones, particularly those with rotary wings, in dealing with the pandemic. Much effort has been devoted to developing a rotary-wing drone system as a flying platform for aerial monitoring. However, several factors must be considered when visually observing a specific region, i.e., the area's size, topographic contours, locations of special interest inside the area, approach points to the area, and the observation timeframe. Since fever is a common symptom of COVID-19, human body temperature monitoring is highlighted for fever screening, with the objective of minimizing people with high body temperatures going to the crowd. A major challenge is creating a system that can provide accurate body temperature data, which is critical for fighting the pandemic. The purpose of this paper is to present a rotary wing drone application for aerial human body temperature measurements. The paper also proposed an alternative solution based on using a portable, low-cost, Forward-looking Infrared (FLIR) thermal imaging camera. The FLIR thermal camera is incorporated into the drone's electronic system. Furthermore, thermal image data are transmitted into the ground station via a radio telemetry transceiver to allow flexible surveillance by the operator. Indoor and outdoor experiments reveal that the system has been effectively installed and provide data collection for further research. The results show that the system can be used for small-scale area aerial monitoring. © 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved."

ALO consists of four guided searches and one random search, performed in three phases: two mandatory and one optional. In the first phase, the guided search is conducted with the best global solution as the reference.

Sensors that are commonly used to be able to identify human activities are cameras or wearable sensors. However, cameras and wearable sensors have several weaknesses, such as the camera cannot capture images in the dark, and the use of wearable sensors has many things to consider for user comfort. So, an alternative way to solve those problems is to use radar as a sensor base for HAR. This study proposes methods by presenting an explanation of signal processing from raw data signals to images containing only the target distance information and then comparing the number of convolutional layers and the number of epochs to determine the best Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to perform HAR using uRAD Radar Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave by Anteral.

Therefore, measuring whether a company is distressed or non-distressed can be done by looking at the ratios derived from the components of the financial statements from both the balance sheet and the company's profit and loss. This study offers a new method for measuring financial distress in companies with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The model provided comes from several financial ratios in 17 construction companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The model is expected to produce the best model by showing the lowest prediction error rate. The results showed that the best ANN model has 25 inputs, 20 hidden layer neurons, and 1 best model output. The model obtained will be tested directly on the sample used; the results are that 6 construction companies in Indonesia have financial distress and 11 non-distress problems. This result proves that the best model obtained can predict the level of financial distress of companies with a small error rate to produce 6 companies identified as financially distressed. This result can be a warning for companies to increase revenue by adding new projects to get out of financial distress status.

The most common types of cancer with high mortality are lung and colon cancer. One of the efforts to reduce cases of death is early diagnosis followed by medical therapy. Tissue sampling and clinical pathological examination are the gold standard in cancer diagnosis. However, in some cases, pathological examination of tissue to the cell level requires high accuracy, depending on the contrast of the pathological image, and the experience of the clinician. Therefore, we need an image processing approach combined with artificial intelligence for automatic classification. In this study, a method is proposed for automatic classification of lung and colon cancer based on a deep learning approach. The object of the image that is classified is the histopathological image of normal tissue, benign cancer, and malignant cancer. Convolutional neural network (CNN) with VGG16 architecture and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) were employed for demonstration of classification on 25000 histopathological images. The simulation results show that the proposed method is able to classify with a maximum accuracy of 98.96%. The system performance using CLAHE shows a higher detection accuracy than without using CLAHE and is consistent for all epoch scenarios. The comparative study shows that the proposed method outperforms some previous studies. With this proposed method, it is hoped that it can help clinicians in diagnosing cancer automatically, with low cost, high accuracy, and fast processing on large datasets. © The Author(s).

One of the tools to help neurologists diagnose epilepsy relies on EEG signals extensively because it can represent the brain's neuron activity. Due to the EEG signal being considered a complex biological signal, the signal complexity-based feature extraction method is suitable for characterizing epileptic EEG signals. One method for extracting EEG signals is entropy which is able to quantify signal complexity. Several previously proposed methods were wavelet entropy and IMF entropy. This study proposed multi-distance signal level difference (MSLD) entropy as a feature extraction method to extract the EEG signal complexity. The decomposed signal from MSLD was then extracted using entropy measurement. In the classification process, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied to classify the normal, pre-ictal, and ictal signals of EEG signals. The highest accuracy of 96% was obtained using cubic SVM as the classifier.

However, the accuracy resulting from the classification process is not optimal. This research aims to use the transfer learning method to achieve optimal accuracy. In this research, we used three classes, namely without a mask, incorrect mask, and with a mask. The use of these three classes is expected to be more detailed in detecting violations of the use of masks on the face. The classification method used in this research uses transfer learning as feature extraction and Global Average Pooling and Dense layers as classification layers. The transfer learning models used in this research are MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and DenseNet201. We evaluate the three models’ accuracy and processing time when using video data. The experimental results show that the DenseNet201 model achieves an accuracy of 93%, but the processing time per video frame is 0.291 s. In contrast to the MobileNetV2 model, which produces an accuracy of 89% and the processing speed of each video frame is 0.106 s. This result is inversely proportional to accuracy and speed. The DenseNet201 model produces high accuracy but slow processing time, while the MobileNetV2 model is less accurate but has faster processing. This research can be applied in the crowd center to monitor health protocols in the use of masks in the hope of inhibiting the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

It is possible to put that plant inside a miniature Green House with sufficient temperature. Temperature controller in the Corn Plantation Green House for this research used a NI DAQ device as an interface between Personal Computer, where the controller is created using LabVIEW software, and a heater. The control process is carried out using Model Predictive Controller (MPC). The purpose is to obtain a sufficient temperature value in the Corn Green House system. The output is in a duty cycle percentage that is connected to driver L298N which is also connected to the heater. This research uses DAQ LabVIEW. The temperature is measured by LM35 Sensor. Various Prediction Horizon (Np), Control horizon (Nc), and static Gain are used to find the most suitable parameter to control the temperature using Model predictive controller. Using a sufficient tuning, the right value for temperature to grow Corn plantation can be obtained. Results show that the best parameter can be reached by using MPC at Np = 30, Nc = 2, Static Gain = 3, and Delay = 5. This setting can achieve a stable temperature of 30,8 ℃ faster than other settings. But for different parameters, it can reach a stable temperature albeit at different set points. It can be concluded that Different parameters in Prediction Horizon and Control horizon give significant effect to the performance. This research can obtain the right adjustment to get sufficient temperature using Model Predictive Control for Miniature Green House. This can be used for Corn farmers who want to control the temperature inside the Green House. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

In Indonesia, society lacks fluency in national sign languages like Indonesian Sign Language (SIBI), which can affect their self-confidence and social interaction skills with others. Previous studies generally used a camera in dataset retrieval in sign language recognition. There is a weakness in using the camera because it has to pay attention to environmental conditions, such as being influenced by light intensity. Radar can correct this deficiency because it uses electromagnetic waves. In this study proposed, the use of uRAD radar by Antheral based on radar Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) to detect and then collect words of SIBI for raw data that is IQ signals. The proposed technique applies the preprocessing methods for the frequency-domain IQ signals of radar echoes as input to a convolutional neural network (CNN). The system designed is able to classify five words of Indonesian Sign Language into five classes. Thereafter compare three self-constructed architectures to find the best model with differences in the number of convolution and pooling layers in each architecture. The results of the proposed architectural classification show the movement classification accuracy exceeds more than 98%.

Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), one of the multiple access techniques, has been researched to gain high spectral efficiency. Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO), meanwhile, is an antenna technology that can increase the spectral efficiency of wireless networks. A combination of NOMA and MIMO is able to cope with an overloaded scenario. However, this benefit lies in the massive demand for accurate Channel State Information at Transmitter (CSIT). Imperfect CSIT can arise multiuser interference problems, a significant problem for wireless networks in MIMO technology. Another promising multiple access strategy, known as Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA), has been researched for interference management. This multiple access scheme is expected to have better interference management capabilities for being more adaptive to the level of interference. When combined with MIMO systems, RSMA can overcome the imperfect conditions of CSIT compared to Power-Domain NOMA and Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA). However, its performance on some user deployment conditions gives only a little sum rate enhancements. This paper proposes a multiple access technique using Rate-Splitting on a Multiuser MIMO system with power distribution adjustments. By controlling the distribution of power in spatial domain, we could maximize the rate region across multiple user deployments. This adjustment controlled the power distribution before sending data to the user in the downlink communication.  © 2023 IEEE."

As its name suggests, QTO proposes a new approach of metaheuristic in which there are four searches conducted by each agent in every iteration. These searches are: (1) searching toward the global best solution, (2) searching toward the middle between the global best solution and a randomly selected solution, (3) searching relative to a randomly selected solution, and (4) neighbourhood search around the corresponding solution and the global best solution. A solution candidate is generated by each search. Then, a tournament is carried out to find the best candidate. This strategy is novel because most of metaheuristic deploys only single search or multiple searches where each search is conducted sequentially. QTO is challenged to find the optimal solution of 23 classic functions. In this challenge, QTO is benchmarked against five shortcoming metaheuristics: marine predator algorithm (MPA), slime mould algorithm (SMA), golden search optimizer (GSO), hybrid pelican Komodo algorithm (HPKA), and guided pelican algorithm (GPA). The result indicates that QTO outperforms all these benchmark metaheuristics. QTO is better than MPA, SMA, GSO, HPKA, and GPA in solving 22, 19, 21, 20, and 13 functions consecutively. The result also indicates that QTO has successfully found the global optimal solution for nine functions: Sphere, Schwefel 2.22, Schwefel 1.2, Schwefel 2.21, Rastrigin, Griewank, Six Hump Camel, Branin, and Goldstein-Price. © 2023,International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems.All Rights Reserved."

Abnormalities in the heart can usually be detected when there is an additional sound during an incomplete valve opening. Additional sounds in cardiac abnormalities can be called murmurs. Normal and murmur heart sound happen in different frequency. Therefore, frequency-based feature extraction can be used to classify heart sound. One of frequency domains is power spectrum that can be calculated for power by two frequency of signal, and it can clearly show the pattern of murmur and normal heart sound. In this research, the proposed feature extraction based on the power spectrum feature is used to become another option feature extraction for heart sound classification, which is different from previous heart sound classification studies. There are five types of feature extraction that developed base power spectrum, which are Mean Frequency, Total Power, Maximum Peak Frequency, 1st Spectral Moment, and 2nd Spectral moment. Several classifiers also are used to get the best classier base that features. The best selection feature of this research is Mean Frequency, with best classifier are Stochastic Gradient Descent and logistic regression and accuracy 93%. When all features are used for classifier, almost all of the models have the highest accuracy especially when classifier with mean frequency, 1st Spectral, and 2nd Spectral moment has good accuracy too. Using all features, the best classifier for heart sound case is Gaussian Naïve Bayes with accuracy reaching 100%. These excellent outcomes can elevate feature extraction to the top contender and help machine learning generate effective classifiers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

This research found that an e-commerce platform in Indonesia lacked design aspects in its online review and recommender system results that should be improved. This research combined user information behavior (UIB) with a lean startup approach (build-measure-learn). To achieve the expected user goals, designing an online review in e-commerce must consider how users interact with the online review and recommender system. It also should consider the e-commerce users' and owners' perspectives. This research improved and evaluated the design of the existing e-commerce in Indonesia. Firstly, it adopted the UIB approach to detail the design of the e-commerce online review and recommender system's results related to the review features. Then, it performed the initial usability testing to get rapid feedback from ten study participants using the maze tools to measure a usability task and heatmap tracing. Lastly, this research followed up and evaluated the results of the initial usability testing using the build-measure-learn approach. The results revealed that UIB implementation for designing the online review and recommender system results as follows. The redesign had better misclick rate (31.7% compared to original design 41.7%), better average success (46.2% compared to original design 33.3%), easier to use (4.3 in 5 likert scale compared to original design 3.7) and all participants chosen the multiple filter feature compared to single filter in original design and participants chosen to the addition of like and dislike feature in the proposed design. These results were captured from the participants study through rapid feedback based on the user information behavior when using the online review. From a design perspective, it can help an e-commerce designer to improve other aspects of the e-commerce features. © 2023 Global IT Research Institute (GiRI)."

However, migrating computing from the cloud to the edge becomes more challenging due to the limited capacity of the microcontroller’s flash memory and the large size of the KNN model. This paper proposes shuffle split-edited nearest neighbor (SSENN), a novel method to compress intelligent control models for smart lighting while maintaining its performance. The method adopts the high compression ratio (CR) of random under-sampling (RU) and the high accuracy of edited nearest neighbor (ENN). The methodology trains basic KNN and observes its performance and characteristics as the number of datasets increases. Then we synthesize the SSENN on the KNN and further evaluate and benchmark the model with RU and ENN. The test results show that KNN + SSENN has higher $$\text {Average}\pm \text {Std. Dev.}$$ accuracy than KNN + RU, which is $$0.915\pm 0.01$$. In addition, the CR of KNN + SSENN is higher than KNN + ENN, which is 2.60.

This is evident through the increasing number of mobile network operators (MNOs) users, especially in the current era where most things are accomplished online. Consequently, mobile network operators must furnish a comprehensive array of cellular network access services, not just for smartphones but also for other smart devices, to guarantee maximum coverage. With the growing interest in 5G deployment based on low band and millimeter wave communication (mm Wave) for outdoor use scenarios, such as tourist destinations, site design experts are looking for sophisticated real-time traffic data from social media like Twitter to simulate and calculate outdoor radio coverage using 3GPP 38.901 prediction models.

However, Li-Fi requires accurate device positioning for line of sight (LOS) conditions to meet the main requirement for light communication. Conventional Li-Fi design models require a more dynamic transmitter and receiver device settings but can still serve LOS communication well. This study aims to design a Li-Fi communication model by varying the transmitting devices, such as the use of fixed and movable LEDs, and receiving devices, such as the addition of optical rectangle filters, low-pass filters, and trans-impedance amplifiers. The focus of observation includes the effect of changes in wavelength, data transmission speed, transmitter half-angle, irradiance angle, and incidence angle, as well as field of view (FOV) on received power parameters, signal-to-noise ratio, Q-factor, and bit error rate (BER). On the basis of the test results, the performance of all wavelength variations meets the ITU-T standard up to a variation of the transmission distance of 8 m, where the use of fixed and movable LEDs does not result in a significant difference in performance. The test results indicate that the wavelength parameter affects the signal quality due to the spectral response and LEDs emission. For short distances, the wavelength of 450 nm has better performance, whereas for distances up to 8 m, the wavelength of 650 nm has a better performance than other variations. Furthermore, increasing the transmitter half-angle increased the BER value and drastically decreased the Q factor. The use of a smaller FOV is recommended, as shown from the increase in distance resulting in a significant decrease in performance. The proposed system model can also be used for bit rates up to 30 Mbps, although it is only reliable up to 6 m. As for the 40 Mbps variation, the 75° half-angle transmitter, 60° FOV, and 90° FOV variations do not meet the standard. The two system models do not have a significant difference in performance.

As a result, the availability of this energy is decreasing. Because of this, other energy alternatives are needed. One example of another option is the use of biomass. An example of using biomass is the gasification process. This process was carried out in a device called a gasification stove, namely a gasifier. A gasifier has been developed to produce an optimal combustion system. The constraints in this development are costs for manufacture and the potential for failure. Therefore, simulations using Ansys Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software student versions were carried out to reduce the costs for manufacture and the potential for failure of the gasifier. The simulation contains dimensional variations and the number of air inlets of gasifier of downdraft gasifier, updraft gasifier, and entrained flow gasifier. Further, the influence of the dimensions and quantity of inlet that affect each design's efficiency and the temperature was examined. The simulation results show that the best dimensions for the downdraft gasifier, updraft gasifier, and entrained flow gasifier are height and diameter of 50cm; 14.5cm (A1), 144cm; 70cm (C1), and 900cm; 300cm (B3), respectively. The best number of air inlets of A1, C1, and B3 gasifiers is 6, 1, and 6, respectively. Thus, the efficiency of each gasifier A1, C1, and B3 are 11.393%, 9.354%, and 50.885%, respectively. Furthermore, the A1, C1, and B3 gasifiers temperatures were 1055.25 K, 1383.44 K, and 3580.15 K, respectively.

In addition to big data, small data often experiences similar problems such as data loss, especially on time series-based data. Several things can cause data loss, one of which is the data communication problem caused by the network on the Internet of Things (IoT) system. Losing data in data conditions that are quite volatile is also quite a challenge. Not all methods can produce good accuracy in dealing with fluctuating data cases. The method used to impute small volatile data in this study is Lagrange interpolation. Several methods used for the data imputation process consist of Lagrange interpolation of degree one (linear), degree two (quadratic), and degree three (cubic). Lagrange cubic interpolation generally provides better accuracy with data loss percentages of 10%, 30%, and 50% compared to several other types of polynomial interpolation indicated by the MSE value. Indirectly, the results of this research can predict that if the application of Lagrange interpolation on fluctuating data has good accuracy, then Lagrange interpolation can have the same accuracy as non-fluctuating data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

Currently, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technique is frequently utilized to solve the age estimation problem. However, this method has one disadvantage, namely a high computational cost that lengthens the training process. This paper proposes an alternative method for resolving age estimation issues. To overcome the shortcomings of the backpropagation method, the proposed method employs the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm as a fully-connected CNN layer. ResNet50 and VGG16 are the CNN architectures employed in this study. Using the UTKFace dataset, the proposed method was trained and evaluated. Using ELM as a fully-connected layer on CNN provided significantly faster training time performance than the fully-connected layer trained with the backpropagation technique. In addition, the proposed combination of CNN and ELM can provide age classification performance that is competitive with state-of-the-art method for age estimation cases.  © 2023 IEEE."

The conventional methods for calculating wave run-up involve physical experiments or numerical modeling. Machine learning methods have recently become a part of wave run-up model development due to their robustness in dealing with large and complex data. In this paper, an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based machine learning method is introduced for predicting wave run-up on a sloping beach. More than 400 laboratory observations of wave run-up were utilized as training datasets to construct the XGBoost model. The hyperparameter tuning through the grid search approach was performed to obtain an optimized XGBoost model. The performance of the XGBoost method is compared to that of three different machine learning approaches: multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF). The validation evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other machine learning approaches in predicting the wave run-up with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.98675, a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.635%, and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.03902. Compared to empirical formulas, which are often limited to a fixed range of slopes, the XGBoost model is applicable over a broader range of beach slopes and incident wave amplitudes. • The optimized XGBoost method is a feasible alternative to existing empirical formulas and classical numerical models for predicting wave run-up. • Hyperparameter tuning is performed using the grid search method, resulting in a highly accurate machine-learning model. • Our findings indicate that the XGBoost method is more applicable than empirical formulas and more efficient than numerical models. © 2023 The Author(s)"

The data obtained from 400 respondents were processed using Pearson's chi-square and post hoc tests. The results showed that there are significant differences between the demographic variables and approaches. It was revealed that men behave better than women in terms of adopting settings and add-on utilities, preventive behavior, and disaster/data recovery. On the other hand, men tend to have riskier behavior than women in avoiding harmful behavior. Based on generation, it was found that Generation Z exhibits more secure behavior than Generation Y in terms of settings and add-on utilities regarding remote device locking. Meanwhile, Generation Z has better behavior than Generations X and Y in preventive behavior as they uninstall/remove unused applications. Furthermore, undergraduate users behave better than high schoolers in avoiding harmful behaviors such as sharing PIN/passwords.

For farmers, predicting the start of the rainy season is very important. This is because it is related to the cost factor that must be incurred, and also, the waiting time for the harvest has an effect if the weather is not supportive. Farmers also have to prepare seeds for the start of their farming. Therefore, farmers who start nurseries early in the rainy season will miss significant planting time. Based on these problems, this study uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for weather classification using cloud imagery. CNN is shown to classify different spectro-temporal features of sound and is thus suitable for cloud image classification. We collect cloud image data using secondary data. Our model used a layer based on the convolution CNN architecture with a pooling layer and a solid layer as the output layer. The cloud dataset used is 1230 data divided into five classes, namely cloudy, foggy, rain, shine, and sunrise, which we use to train our model in research for the feature extraction process using DenseNet and VGG19. We use two types of classification, namely fully connected and Global Average Pooling (GAP). Our model can achieve a classification accuracy of 90.8% DenseNet-Fully Connected from our training process.

This price increase was due to farmers’ chili supply shortage because of disease that attacked chili plants in various areas. Early detection of chili plant diseases is essential to maintain the quality and productivity of crop yields. Research related to the detection of chili plant diseases has been developed by many researchers, for example, using machine learning techniques. Previous research used machine learning to classify three classes of chili diseases. The results of this research are not optimal because the amount of data used is small, so it only reaches 86% accuracy. Therefore, we propose using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method, which is part of deep learning. This research contributes to building a CNN architectural model for processing small datasets. We developed the CNN architecture to process small amounts of data. The dataset consists of 5 classes: healthy, leaf curl, leaf spot, whitefly, and yellowish. The raw data obtained is pre-processed before going to the feature extraction stage. The reason for pre-processing is to homogenize the size and augment the data. The results of the pre-processing data will be used for feature extraction and classification using CNN. We also compare the results of using CNN with the DenseNet201 transfer learning model. The test results using the confusion matrix obtained an accuracy of 92% on the use of the DenseNet201 model, while on CNN, it produced an accuracy of 94%.

However, password-based authentication is vulnerable to password-guessing attacks. To mitigate this attack, users have to choose a good password that is hard to guess. However, a password secured enough from password-guessing attacks will be difficult for users to memorize. One of the prior works that increase the complexity of password-guessing attacks without decreasing the usability is honey encryption (HE). HE produced a fake plausible-looking plaintext as the decoy message when the attacker guessed the incorrect password. Some research implements the HE into an authentication scheme. However, the authentication scheme using HE has some weaknesses. The decoy message just uses one word and is still suspicious to the attacker. All of the decoy messages also have to be stored in the database. To address these problems, we proposed an authentication system that used honey sentences as the confirmation message instead of a word. Honey sentence is dynamically generated using natural language and has to be natural enough to fool the attacker. When the attacker inputs the incorrect password, the honey sentence is returned to the attacker, such that he could not determine the correctness of the guessed password. The experiment result showed that 80,67% of the generated sentences are considered natural, and the complexity of finding the correct password from all possible passwords is higher than the previous methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

There is a need to find a solution to prevent it, like regularly checking the eyes of patients to detect DR class. But the detection process also takes a long time and requires a large amount of money. So, this study proposed a deep learning method using CNN by implementing the MobilenetV2 architecture, which is a lightweight model and mobile-friendly architecture. In this study, we used the primary dataset from the APTOS 2019 dataset, which contains 3662 retinal fundus images. Diabetic retinopathy is divided into 5 classes, starting from No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferative DR. To produce an optimal class classification in this study, first balance the dataset scheme to 800 in each class by using image augmentation and implementing circle cropping. So, the highest results are obtained with this method with the following parameters: batch size of 32, learning rate of 0.001, RMSProp optimizer, and epoch 100. Testing accuracy is 92.6% as a result of this parameter. The macro precision, recall, and f1-score are 92.8%, 92.6%, and 92.4%, respectively. Our results show that augmentation techniques and circle crop methods can make the MobileNetV2 architecture bring good performance results, and several parameters can bring significant system performance results.

Indoor air quality is influenced by various parameters, especially PM 2,5, from a mixture of air outside and inside the room itself. If the occupants are exposed to this parameter continuously, it will affect the occupant's health significantly. Hence, it is necessary to control indoor air quality if this parameter exceeds the specified quality standards. One technology to reduce PM 2,5 is an air purifier. Air purifiers are generally composed of an exhaust fan, HEPA filter, and pre-filter. One of the air purifiers' evolution is the smart-air-purifier. Smart-air-purifier can automatically adjust the speeds of the fan so as can minimizes electricity costs. The designed smart system can classify PM 2,5 concentration based on fuzzy logic to flow rate settings using pulse width modulation (PWM). In addition, to analyze the performance of the smart air purifier, we test it in a chamber. The test results show the performance of the smart air purifier in reducing PM 2,5, the clean air delivery rate measurement of the smart air purifier, and its power consumption which can minimize 67.42% of electricity use than commercial air purifiers.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

MPA-HOGO is built by combining two shortcoming metaheuristics: marine predator algorithm (MPA) and hide object game optimization (HOGO). The distinct strategy in MPA-HOGO is as follows. MPA-HOGO utilizes an exploration-to-exploitation strategy gradually as the iteration goes on. It uses the global best solution evaluated in every iteration to ensure that the final solution comes from the best solution found during the iteration. It also eliminates the normalized score of every solution to reduce the computational process. This metaheuristic is then tested by solving 23 classic functions. MPA-HOGO is benchmarked with particle swarm optimization (PSO), Komodo mlipir algorithm (KMA), MPA, and HOGO. The result indicates that MPA-HOGO is superior among these metaheuristics. MPA-HOGO is also competitive in solving practical optimization problems. Through simulation, MPA-HOGO produces 13%, 7%, and 2% lower total costs than PSO, MPA, and HOGO respectively in solving inventory management problems in the vendor-managed inventory system. © 2023, International Association of Engineers.

A hybrid waveguide is a type of four-ports device widely used as a feeding network to produce sum and diff beams. This paper deals with the miniaturization of feeding network monopulse antenna using substrate integrated waveguide (SIW). The proposed feeding network which is developed based on SIW structure will be compared with the conventional one, which has a bulky structure, to determine the miniaturization ratio. Parameters of the feeding network such as physical dimension, return loss, insertion loss, isolation, and phase difference will be analyzed to determine the performance of proposed feeding network after miniaturization. The proposed feeding network is deployed on a double side 1.524 mm thick Rogers RO-4003C dielectric substrate. The characterization results show that the proposed feeding network performs well in each port with the phase difference of 180°. In comparison to the conventional one, the use of SIW structure is ultra-compact and implementable in finite space.  © 2023 IEEE."

One area that attracts many domestic and foreign tourists is Yogyakarta. Tourists who don't know Yogyakarta, of course, need the services of a travel agent to plan a tourist visit. For backpackers, the services of this travel agent are very expensive. It would be better if there was an application that could recommend tourist routes based on tourist needs. However, not many applications have been developed that are able to accommodate this. Therefore, in this study, we propose a recommender system that is able to generate travel itineraries for tourist visits in a few days. Users are given the flexibility to customize optimal tourist routes based on this need is divided into four criteria, such as 1) tourist routes with as many tourist attractions as possible visited per day, 2) tourist routes that minimize the budget, and 3) tourist routes that visit popular places, 4) time to start and end the tourist visit. Searching for optimal tourist objects involves an algorithm capable of solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The algorithm that we use in this study is the Simulated Annealing Algorithm. In addition, to accommodate the needs of our users we use the Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT). To test the performance of our proposed system, we use the Firefly Algorithm as the base model. Based on the results of the tests, the Simulated Annealing Algorithm is better in terms of the average number of days that can be visited per node, fitness value, and running time than the Firefly Algorithm. © 2023 IEEE."

Data governance is a challenge in banks due to the high level of confidentiality and the involvement of regulators in data management and technology implementation. Big data requires technology to manage it, while technology investment is a challenge, namely how technology investment to manage big data can contribute to generating value in business. There are two main points in this study: the first is about building capability, and the second is generating value. Through the literature review, it is known that there are challenges to optimizing the capability of data technology implementation and analytics business cases in the banking industry to create business value. The challenges to building capabilities as a basis for data-driven business are data characteristics, data processing, data accessibility, data literacy, and data technology. The challenge is determining how to improve data accessibility and data literacy. When the capability has been built, generating value can be done on top of that, namely by increasing revenue, reducing costs, and lowering risk. To do this, it is necessary to run business use case analytics whose results can be measured, which focus on personalization and recommendations, optimizing processes with automation and integration, and optimizing credit risk. The results of the literature review are described in a conceptual model of capability development to generate value, which is the basis for developing a business strategy that can increase business value. Customer-centric analytics should be implemented by embedding an analytics engine in bank applications such as mobile banking, internet banking, or customer relationship management (CRM) applications that will improve the user experience such as personalization and recommendation as the keys to improving customer solutions. The impact is to increase customer attachment to a bank's applications and products because customers not only carry out daily banking activities but also have embedded insights that help them in their decision-making. By implementing Explore Understand Action Engage (EUAE) for customer journey, customer-centric analytics provide customers with a comprehensive view of their bank account activity and control over their money management, improve customer engagement by providing insights and recommendation. © 2023, Success Culture Press.

In outdoor applications, internet sources such as WIFI are not always available, so it requires alternative data communications such as nRF24l01. The system also requires a portable power source such as solar power. This research aims to develop a vibration propagation analysis system based on the nRF24l01 wireless sensor network and solar power by implementing the fuzzy rule-based regression (FRBR) algorithm. The system consists of two piezoelectric and nrf24l01 vibration sensors. The system also uses a third node equipped with temperature and soil moisture sensors, air temperature and humidity, and light intensity as environmental variables. The evaluation results show the Quality of Services (QoS) results with a throughput of 99.564%, PDR 99.675%, and a delay of 0.0073s. The Fuzzy Association Rule (FAR) extraction results yield nine rules with average support of 0.319 and confidence of 1 for vibration propagation. The availability of solar power was evaluated with an average current value of 0.250A and a voltage of 3.266V. The results of FRBR are based on the propagation of the vibration that propagated and produced a mean square error (MSE) of 0.141 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.165. The correlation matrix and FAR results show that only soil moisture has a major effect on the magnitude and duration of propagation. However, other variables can regress soil moisture with MSE 0.232 and MAE 0.287. © 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved."

The resolution of the grid from global wave forecasting systems is usually too coarse to capture wave propagation in the coastal area. This problem is usually resolved by performing dynamic downscaling that simulates the global wave condition into a smaller domain with a high-resolution grid, which requires a high computational cost. This paper proposes a deep learning-based downscaling method for predicting a significant wave height in the coastal area from global wave forecasting data. We obtain high-resolution wave data by performing a continuous wave simulation using the SWAN model via nested simulations. The dataset is then used as the training data for the deep learning model. Here, we use the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) as the deep learning models. We choose two study areas, an open sea with a swell-dominated area and a rather close sea with a wind-wave-dominated area. We validate the results of the downscaling with a wave observation, which shows good results. © 2023 by the authors."

Our study demonstrates that successful ICT-enabled national development is not contingent on pursuing one strategy or the other but on how micro-level actors interpret, and subsequently respond to, these strategies and the local changes they trigger. Our findings indicate that centralisation and decentralisation are complementary rather than competing strategies to ICT-enabled national development because, if integrated into a hybrid strategy, decentralisation enables local communities to achieve national development outcomes commonly attributed to centralisation. As such, our work provides empirical evidence, explanations and new theoretical insight into the wider ‘centralisation versus decentralisation’ debate, while also outlining avenues for future research and guidelines for policymakers. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Specifically, this study aimed to elucidate if there is an ecological advantage in the five different locations in the world-centered coordinates. The pupillary responses to glare and halo stimuli indicated that the brightness perception differed among the five locations in the world-centered coordinates.

In general, the vertical extrapolation of WS at different heights must consider different parameters from different locations, such as wind shear coefficient, roughness length, and atmospheric conditions. The novelty presented in this article is the introduction of two steps optimization for the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) model to estimate WS at different heights using measurements from lower heights. The first optimization of the RNN is performed to minimize a differentiable cost function, namely, mean squared error (MSE), using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Secondly, the RNN is optimized to reduce a non-differentiable cost function using simulated annealing (RNN-SA), namely mean absolute error (MAE). Estimation of WS vertically at 50 m height is done by training RNN-SA with the actual WS data a 10–40 m heights. The estimated WS at height of 50 m and the measured WS at 10–40 heights are further used to train RNN-SA to obtain WS at 60 m height. This procedure is repeated continuously until the WS is estimated at a height of 180 m. The RNN-SA performance is compared with the standard RNN, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and state of the art methods like convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extrapolate the WS vertically. The estimated values are also compared with real WS dataset acquired using LiDAR and tested using four error metrics namely, mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean bias error (MBE), and coefficient of determination (R2). The numerical experimental results show that the MSE values between the estimated and actual WS at 180 m height for the RNN-SA, RNN, MLP, and SVM methods are found to be 2.09, 2.12, 2.37, and 2.63, respectively. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

Previously dominated by face-to-face learning methods, student learning has fully transitioned into full e-learning, or online/distance learning provides a completely new experience for students. Students are important learning recipients and university stakeholders. Therefore, much attention should be paid to their learning satisfaction to ensure that higher education’s learning process is conducted well during a pandemic. The absence of quantitative empirical research on the drivers of e-learning satisfaction in the setting of private higher education is the theoretical impetus for this study. This study evaluated a learning satisfaction model during (early) the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire survey with a sample of 722 undergraduate students from a top-ranking private university was conducted in Indonesia, which reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia in 2020. Survey results identify the social presence, confirmation, and student-student interaction as the drivers of e-learning satisfaction during the pandemic. Moreover, robust learning system quality has a significant indirect influence on learning satisfaction that is mediated by student-student interaction. The findings of this study can provide implications for private university administrators in Indonesia to pay attention to and make improvements related to social presence, confirmation, learning system quality, and student-student interaction during a pandemic. © 2022 The Author(s).

The paper uses data from Asia Pacific countries and dynamic heterogeneous panel method analysis to determine factors of household debt. The results find that financial development and financial institution access have a long-run positive relationship, stable and convergent with household debt. This implies that as the financial system developed, as evidenced by easy access to financial institutions, it provided some attractive financial instruments and financial markets became liquid. As a result, household debt increased due to easier access to financing and credit options that matched people's needs. However, in the short run, financial development and financial institution access do not strongly affect household debt of countries overall. Also, the real interest rate and housing price have a positive impact, and stock capital accumulation and household consumption harm household debt in the long run. Therefore, supervision of the volatility of household debt and financial development are important for sustainable economic growth. Copyright © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

Manual labour is usually labour-intensive, has higher risks of musculoskeletal disorders, and produces frequent occurrences of errors and losses. Furthermore, the current studies of suitable concepts and test protocols for roof tile transportation at the manufacturing stage as well as their inspection systems are not practicable in Indonesia. There is also no study that has used the theory of inventive problem-solving (TRIZ) in the development of concepts and protocols for roof tile transportation and inspection systems. Using TRIZ as a supporting tool, this study investigated the development of a transportation system to be employed during the manufacturing of the roof tile and a test protocol for their usability in Indonesian companies to overcome this concern. The study included screening and scoring concepts and usability test protocols identified from the existing literature, with the support of TRIZ tools such as the engineering contradiction, contradiction matrix, and inventive principles. Thus, the finalised concept comprised a belt conveyor system (Inventive Principle 20: Continuity of Useful Action) with a flipping mechanism for transportation and a vision-based camera for inspection. Results of the study showed that the concept excelled in cost, durability, reliability, versatility, low risk to the product, efficiency, and safety. The t-test protocol (Inventive Principle 23: Feedback) was selected based on the results due to its versatility in testing efficiency, reliability, and productivity. It was concluded that this concept has the potential to alleviate roof tile workers of physical work and reduce the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders. © 2023 by the authors."

Several factors that support the growth of nursery plants are nutritional factors, sunlight, temperature, soil pH, water, and soil moisture. In terms of effectiveness and ease of access to information in monitoring the supporting condition factors and facilitating the farmers, an Android-based monitoring system was built to monitor the growth of nursery plants. The system consists of several sensors, such as a soil pH sensor, UV light sensor, and soil moisture sensor embedded with Raspberry pi and firebase. The proposed system was examined on a plantation area of 900 square meters. The testing is conducted by placing a combination of 4 to 8 sensors in the plantation area. Data from each sensor is processed by calculating the average, and the results are rounded to the nearest value. The test stated that to monitor an area of 900 square meters, the area with five sensors implanted can be used as the optimal implementation. Apart from economic reasons, the minor rounding error equals 8.25% compared to the number of other sensors. The results that are informed to the farmers are also within the appropriate range.

However, the accuracy performance needs to be enhanced as automated heart-sound classification aids in the early detection and prevention of the dangerous effects of cardiovascular problems. In this study, an optimal heart-sound classification method based on machine learning technologies for cardiovascular disease prediction is performed. It consists of three steps: pre-processing that sets the 5 s duration of the PhysioNet Challenge 2016 and 2022 datasets, feature extraction using Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC), and classification using grid search for hyperparameter tuning of several classifier algorithms including k-nearest neighbor (K-NN), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM). The five-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The best model obtained classification accuracy of 95.78% and 76.31%, which was assessed using PhysioNet Challenge 2016 and 2022, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the suggested approach obtained excellent classification results using PhysioNet Challenge 2016 and showed promising results using PhysioNet Challenge 2022.

The implementation of a smart city is one of the infrastructure investments. Smart mobility is one of the service cluster divisions, and smart mobility indicators are taken into account in the implementation. The objective of this study is to convert female mobility patterns and attitudes toward BRT service into smart mobility indicators. The method used is quantitative, and the questionnaire is designed to poll 209 people. Chi-Square and Likert scale are employed to analyze those criteria. The results demonstrate that the BRT has provided the female passenger services that they require at the current service level. The passenger pattern demonstrates that women depend on the BRT service to meet their transportation needs. Furthermore, the ICT criteria as a core for smart mobility has been challenging for both parties (female passengers and BRT operator).

Using system GMM, the result shows that on average the wage spillover in production jobs within an industry positively affects the TFP, while the wage spillover in non-production jobs contributes negatively. Moreover, the wage spillover in production jobs and non-production jobs within a province do not affect the TFP of Indonesian manufacturing firms. These results indicate that employees in production jobs have larger contributions to increasing TFP than those in non-production jobs when foreign firms increase their wages. Such contributions occur within an industry, not within a province.

The LQR controller, the inner-loop controller, is designed based on the derived BBS dynamics model. Then FLC, the outer-loop controller, is designed to get the desired tracking error dynamics. By using LQR-FLC, one can use the simple PD controller to design the tracking error dynamics. In addition, the estimator is designed to provide the controller with the full-states information. This research is worth investigating because the LQR-FLC scheme for controlling the BBS is missing in the literature.

TIA is a swarm intelligence which relies on the interaction among solutions in the population. The core and distinct concept of TIA is that each solution interacts with all other solutions in every iteration to find the best possible solution. Then, this new alternative replaces the current solution if it is better than the current solution. In this research, TIA is tested to solve 23 functions that represent both unimodal and multimodal problems. TIA is benchmarked with five metaheuristics: particle swarm optimization (PSO), marine predator algorithm (MPA), golden search optimizer (GSO), guided pelican algorithm (GPA), and driving training-based optimizer (DTBO). The result indicates that TIA is superior to other benchmark metaheuristics, especially in solving the high dimension functions. TIA is better than PSO, MPA, GSO, GPA, and DTBO in 22, 21, 16, 11, 13 functions. The result also indicates that the increase of the maximum iteration improves the performance of TIA mostly in solving high dimension unimodal functions.

This name is chosen based on its novel mechanism in adopting multiple searches into a single metaheuristic. These multiple searches consist of three guided searches and three random searches. These three guided searches are searching toward the global best solution, searching for the global best solution to avoid the corresponding agent, and searching based on the interaction between the corresponding agent and a randomly selected agent. The three random searches are the local search of the corresponding agent, the local search of the global best solution, and the global search within the entire search space. TOTO is challenged to solve the classic 23 functions as a theoretical optimization problem and the portfolio optimization problem as a real-world optimization problem. There are 13 bank stocks from Kompas 100 index that should be optimized. The result indicates that TOTO performs well in solving the classic 23 functions. TOTO can find the global optimal solution of eleven functions. TOTO is superior to five new metaheuristics in solving 17 functions. These metaheuristics are grey wolf optimizer (GWO), marine predator algorithm (MPA), mixed leader-based optimizer (MLBO), golden search optimizer (GSO), and guided pelican algorithm (GPA). TOTO is better than GWO, MPA, MLBO, GSO, and GPA in solving 22, 21, 21, 19, and 15 functions, respectively.

The problem mainly arises in a flexible manufacturing system, in which machines can be configured with various tools to process different jobs and tool switches will reduce productivity. While the general studies assume uniform set-up time for tool switching, applications in the industries indicate that the set-up time of a tool might depend on the previously installed tool of the same slot. Therefore, this article proposes two integer linear programming models for the sequence-dependent SSP, namely, the five-index formulation and the multicommodity flow formulation. Experimental tests are executed to compare the sequence-dependent SSP with the uniform SSP, and the results show the effectiveness of multicommodity flow formulation.

This study aims to create a chatbot application in the health sector regarding the early diagnosis of pregnancy disorders. Based on basic health research, only 44 percent of pregnant women know the danger signs of pregnancy. The chatbot application developed is expected to facilitate and increase knowledge for pregnant women about the danger signs of pregnancy, especially early diagnosis of pregnancy disorders. The chatbot application was developed with artificial intelligence technology based on Artificial Intelligence Markup Language with the question-answer concept using the Pandorabots framework. The test is carried out in two stages: functional and pattern matching. The functional testing uses the black-box testing method, and the pattern-matching test on the chatbot uses the sentence similarity and bigram methods based on user input and keywords similarity in the bot's knowledge base. The functional testing results show that the chatbot application runs well, with the eligibility criteria reaching 81.4% and the results of the keyword similarity test (pattern matching) are zero to one, in the sense that the value of one has the same similarity between user input and pattern. Meanwhile, the zero value has no similarities, so the bot will respond to it as free input. So it can be concluded that the bot can respond to user questions when the pattern and input have the same level of similarity. © 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved."

All companies must immediately carry out a business transformation following the development of information technology to survive amid increasingly fierce competition. One of the keys to this business transformation's success is an enterprise architecture that is used as a reference in planning, developing, operating, and monitoring company information technology. Implementation of service management practices in state-owned enterprises needs to be translated into IT Services Management Architecture Design, that match the IT Governance Principles as mandated in PER-03/MBU/02/2018. This research focuses on preparing an enterprise architecture design in IT service management by referring to ITIL 4 best practices. The resulting solution is a target architecture design in the business domain, data, and applications arranged according to the TOGAF framework. It was carried out in four stages: scope identification, which defines practices; preliminary phase, which resulted in 11 architecture principles; architecture vision that produces a value chain for IT service provider organizations; a business architecture which resulted in a business service/function catalog consisting of 13 business functions and 43 business services; and an information system architecture that produces a conceptual data model on the three main priority processes of IT service management and an application use-case diagram that describes the relationship between the four actors (users, service managers, service desks, and support groups) with their roles in applications. The enterprise architecture has been designed following the scope of IT service management practices commonly used as a reference for all large and medium-sized companies. © 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

This issue becomes problematic when it is applied in a microfluidic source and sink-based because different dimension leads to different exposure to morphogen resulting in different cell fate. As a model used for biomedical purposes, this problem could lead to a discrepancy. This research is imposed to implement the forecasting method to study the dynamic of organoid growth profile. This approach could help a better understanding via spatiotemporal perspective complemented with a mathematical formula. The forecasting approach that clarifies the trend of this organoid growth by assessing whether the decided trend fits in every (or particular) stage (or not) has not been informed yet. Neural tube organoids have four different mechanical stiffness (0,5 kPa, 2 kPa, 4 kPa, 8kPa) which are documented in three days by time-lapse microscopy used in this experiment. These objects are mapped in a spatiotemporal fashion investigated in the profile and assessed by exponential trend. The actual phenomenon and forecasted result are evaluated by Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Based on the result, the profile of organoid growth indicates that the organoid develops mostly following an exponential profile with the highest R2 value of 0,9868 and the lowest being 0,8734. Based on the MAPE value calculation it could be confirmed that the MAPE value on day 3 is the highest among the others indicating that the extended time of growth tends to have a different profile rather than the exponential trend after day 2. It should be noted that on the lowest stiffness (0,5 kPa) the mechanical properties do not significantly affect the organoid size during the development. Almost all (11 by 12 data or 91,6%) of the MAPE value is in excellent criteria (the value is less than 10%). Only one data does not belong to that classification which is in 8 kPa on day 3. Indicating that the higher stiffness the stronger effect on the system. From the axis development perspective, the organoid does not follow any specific pattern. This research could be a reference for a better understanding of the organoid growth profile in the 3D matrix environment which is nowadays become a hot topic in biomedical applications. © 2023 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland."

It has advantages, especially related to ease of access and process. However, security problems appear related to digital data. There were several information security incidents in the academic environment. In order to mitigate the problem, metrics identification is required to determine the risk of incidents. There are many risks model and metrics to estimate the risk, such as DREAD, OWASP, CVSS, etc. However, specific metrics are required to obtain appropriate risk values. Therefore, this study aims to define metrics for an academic institution. The proposed metrics are obtained from The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulation. It consists of directory information, educational information, personally identifiable information, and risk of information leakage. In order to achieve the objective, this study involves survey and reliability analysis to result in output. The survey is conducted by involving 90 respondents with various levels of education and jobs. The Cronbach's alpha and Test-retest are methods to determine this study's reliability. According to reliability analysis, the Cronbach's alpha method results in coefficients for the metrics between 0.730-0.911, while the Test-retest method results in coefficients between 0.630-0.797. These coefficients have a reliable category, so the proposed metrics are adequate for determining risk of information security incidents in academic environments. The reliable metrics will be developed as variables of the risk assessment model for the academic environment in the future study. © 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved."

The conductivity and capacitance of soil with various NPK concentrations were measured. The main contribution in this study is to provide recommendations on the use of the corresponding electrical parameters for determining NPK levels in the soil. So far, the measurement of the electrical method generally uses the conductivity value for all conditions, even in wet and dry soil conditions. In fact, wet and dry soil conditions affect the conductivity. Therefore, other electrical parameters are needed that can correct the results of NPK measurements in the soil. Conductivity in relation to capacitance can show better measurement validity. In this study, the linearity of the relation between conductivity or capacitance to the addition of NPK levels in the soil was investigated. Soil samples were prepared by varying the mass concentrations of the elements N, P, and K separately. The conductivity and capacitance values for each NPK variation were measured and mapped. The results showed that the conductivity in dry soil conditions was more linear, with average coefficient of determination of the three elements being 0.81, compared to capacitance with a coefficient of determination of 0.72. Whereas the addition of water to the soil sample resulted in better sensitivity and linearity in the capacitance compared to the conductivity, with each average coefficient of determination being 0.55 and 0.34. These results provide alternative solutions using capacitance as an indicator for determination of NPK content in wet soil. The use of capacitance parameters combined with conductivity in determining NPK content in soil is a novelty contribution to this research and can be applied to the measurement technology in agriculture. © The Author(s) 2022."
